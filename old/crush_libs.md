# SugarCraft libraries used by sugar-crush — audit report

**2026-10-07: remediation campaign CLOSED — findings marked inline below; consumer flips + suite-figure re-pin landed with closeout; unpushed-on-master as of this stamp.**

**State as of 2026-10-06, master `ce0c1931e`.** This report covers the 15 SugarCraft libraries that
sugar-crush declares under `require`. It lists findings that are open on current master.

**Verification status — read this before trusting a row.** This round was produced by one review
agent per library, and every agent ran under permission mode `plan` with `Bash` denied. **No
`php -r` probe, no `php -l`, and no `phpunit` run executed anywhere in this round.** These are
static source reads with `file:line` citations, not measured results. That is a downgrade from the
2026-10-03 edition of this file, whose header recorded grep plus throwaway probes.

Two rows were checked by hand against the source afterwards and are marked **LEAD-VERIFIED**; one
agent-reported MAJOR was disproved that way and is recorded under *Disproved* rather than as a
finding. Everything else is unverified. Before any of it is scheduled as work, re-run it with
execution allowed — the probes that would settle each one are named in the row.

## Which libraries sugar-crush uses

sugar-crush lists 15 `sugarcraft/*` packages under `require` and none under `require-dev`. 14 are
referenced from `src/`; `candy-kit` is declared but not wired, deliberately (see its section). The
transitive closure is 22 libraries: the 7 reachable only through siblings (`candy-async`,
`candy-buffer`, `candy-ansi`, `candy-input`, `candy-palette`, `candy-flip`, `honey-bounce`) were
**not audited** in this round.

Counts are from `prompt_kit/tools/crush-dep-surface.php` (output:
`prompt_kit/findings/crush-dep-surface.txt`), which scans `sugar-crush/**.php` excluding `vendor/`
and caches. "Files" is every PHP file naming the FQN prefix, split `src`/`tests`.

| Library | Declared | Files (src/tests) | What crush pulls |
|---|---|---:|---|
| candy-core | `require` | 373 (109/260) | `KeyType` (176), `Msg\KeyMsg` (176), `Util\Width` (76), `Msg` (56), `AsyncCmd` (50), `Util\Ansi` (42), `MouseButton`/`MouseAction`/`Msg\Mouse*Msg`, `BatchMsg` (22), `Msg\WindowSizeMsg` (20), `Util\Color`, `Util\Sanitize`, `I18n\T`, `InputReader`, `View`, `Util\AtomicJsonFile`, `Program`, `Cmd`, `Model` |
| candy-mouse | `require` | 32 (8/24) | `Zone` (19), `Mark` (9), `Sentinel` (9), `Scanner` (3), `MouseEvent`, `ZoneClickTracker`, `Selection`, `SelectionRange` |
| candy-sprinkles | `require` | 45 (29/16) | `Style` (35), `Border` (16), `Bar\Segment`, `Table\Table`, `Layout`, `Position` |
| candy-mosaic | `require` | 21 (5/16) | `Mosaic` (11), `ImageLayer` (4), `ImageSource`, `Capability`, `Renderer\HalfBlockRenderer`, `Renderer\SixelRenderer`, `TmuxPassthroughDecorator`, `Detect` |
| candy-layout | `require` | 20 (6/14) | `Dock\Side` (14), `Dock\DockLayout` (10), `Region` |
| sugar-mcp | `require` | 17 (7/10) | `RequestIdSequence`, `ArgumentShape`, `ExchangeLock` |
| candy-pty | `require` | 10 (3/7) | `Libc`, `Posix\PosixPtySystem`, `Posix\PosixTermios`, `Spawn`, `Pty` |
| candy-fuzzy | `require` | 8 (5/3) | `MatchResult`, `Matcher\SmithWatermanMatcher`, `Highlighter`, `Matcher\CharFold` |
| candy-forms | `require` | 11 (5/6) | `ItemList\{ItemList,Item,LoadMoreMsg}`, `TextArea\TextArea`, `Field\{Input,Confirm,Select}`, `TextInput\TextInput` |
| candy-shine | `require` | 6 (3/3) | `Render\SectionStream` |
| sugar-veil | `require` | 3 (3/0) | `Veil`, `Position` |
| sugar-toast | `require` | 2 (2/0) | inline FQNs only: `Toast::new()->withDuration()->withSymbolSet()->alert(...)`, `ToastType`, `SymbolSet` |
| candy-focus | `require` (`@dev`) | 2 (1/1) | `FocusRing` |
| sugar-diff | `require` | 1 (1/0) | `Diff`, `DiffOptions`, `LineKind` |
| candy-kit | `require` (`@dev`) | 1 (0/1) | **Nothing yet**: the `Cli\Help::screen()` restyle is deferred (E453) |

## Severity index

"Worst open" is the worst finding recorded for the library. "Crush-live" counts findings reachable
from sugar-crush as it is wired today, as distinct from library-level defects no current call site
hits.

|---|---|---:|---:|
| candy-core | MAJOR | 4 | 1 |
| candy-mosaic | MAJOR | 2 | 1 |
| candy-mouse | MAJOR | 3 | 2 |
| candy-shine | MAJOR | 2 | 1 |
| candy-forms | MAJOR | 4 | 1 |
| sugar-mcp | HIGH (carried) | 8 | 4 |

## Cross-library patterns
- **STATUS 2026-10-07:** forked cluster-walker guards ✅ ported verbatim (c5cce07d7); stale `findings/*.md` ✅ re-verify banners (3862a4657); parallel-copy folds (crush McpMessage/McpRouter/McpServer, LspExchangeLock twin, BuildsUnifiedDiff) ⏭ kept as backlog fold items — out of campaign scope.

**Parallel copies drifting from their twin** — still live, and now in two places. sugar-crush keeps
its own `McpMessage`, `MCP\McpRouter` and `MCP\McpServer` beside sugar-mcp's, and hardening has
again landed on only one side (sugar-mcp #2, #7). Separately, sugar-crush's `LSP\LspExchangeLock` is
a hand-rolled twin of sugar-mcp's `ExchangeLock`: the library accumulated fail-closed gates
(`store()`/`markPhase()` returning `false` must abort the exchange, `sweepStale()` on every `new()`)
and nothing tests parity, so each gate has to be noticed and re-landed by hand.

**A forked copy of a canonical helper going stale.** `sugar-toast` carries its own private cluster
walker forked from `candy-core`'s `Width::nextCluster()` and never re-synced the invalid-UTF-8
guards that fix was about (sugar-toast #3). `CALIBER_LEARNINGS.md` for that library says to delegate
to `Width` as the oracle; the code does not.

**The prior per-library audit files are actively costing time.** Six of fifteen agents spent part of
their budget discovering that `findings/<slug>.md` describes code that no longer exists. See
*Stale source-of-truth docs* below — that is the cheapest thing in this report to fix.

# candy-core

### 1. [MAJOR] `AsyncCmd` dispatches into a torn-down runtime; every other deferred path is generation-guarded and this one is not
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed 08555360c — generation guard on the `AsyncCmd` settle callbacks mirrors `deferTick`; the missing `ProgramRuntimeTeardownTest` `AsyncCmd` pins shipped with it.
- **WHERE:** `candy-core/src/Program.php:694-717` — the promise `then()`/`otherwise()` callbacks call `$this->dispatch()` directly. Compare the guard on the tick path at `Program.php:1198-1207` (`deferTick`, runtime-generation checked), and `releaseRuntime()` at `:1170-1181`, which cancels ticks, timers, sequences and pending sends but never cancels or detaches an outstanding promise.
- **WHAT:** An `AsyncCmd` whose promise settles after the program has released its runtime still calls `dispatch()`. `ProgramRuntimeTeardownTest` pins ticks, timers, sequences and send — it has no `AsyncCmd` case, which is why the gap has stayed invisible. sugar-crush drives `Cmd::promise()` from 20+ sites in `src/Chat.php`, so any provider response landing after a quit/restart takes this path.
- **FIX:** Route the `then()`/`otherwise()` bodies through the same generation check `deferTick` uses, or have `releaseRuntime()` detach/cancel pending async handles. Add the missing `AsyncCmd` case to `ProgramRuntimeTeardownTest` — the test is the reason this is still open.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** yes, on the live path. Needs a runtime probe (settle a promise after `releaseRuntime()` and observe `dispatch()`) to confirm the consequence is corruption rather than a benign late no-op.

### 2. [MINOR] `AtomicJsonFile`'s `flock` is dead code, and the docblock claims the protection it cannot provide
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed e4c36bff8 + 96e8fce92 — `LOCK_EX` on a never-unlinked `.<name>.lock` sidecar; `fflush`+`fsync` publish with fail-soft dir-sync on both sides.
- **WHERE:** `candy-core/src/Util/AtomicJsonFile.php:167-220`. The claim is repeated downstream at `sugar-crush/src/Session.php:98`.
- **WHAT:** The exclusive lock is taken on a per-write uniquely-named temp file. Two writers never share that inode, so the lock cannot block anyone — concurrent writes to the same target are unordered. There is also no `fsync` before the rename, so a crash can leave the file present but not durable.
- **FIX:** Lock a stable sidecar path (e.g. `<target>.lock`), or drop the lock and correct the docblock and the `Session.php:98` comment. Do not leave a comment promising mutual exclusion that the code does not implement.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** partially — sugar-crush writes session and config state through it. Single-process today, so the missing exclusion is latent; the false documentation is the live cost.

### 3. [MINOR] `Alt` + a non-ASCII character decodes as Escape + plain character
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed b02128c58 — Alt+non-ASCII now decodes as a single `Char` with `alt=true`; broken sequences degrade honestly to Esc+char.
- **WHERE:** `candy-core/src/InputReader.php:233-241` — the alt-prefixed branch excludes bytes `>= 0x80`.
- **WHAT:** In UTF-8 mode `Alt+é` arrives as `ESC 0xC3 0xA9`; the decoder yields Escape then the character rather than an alt-chord. Existing tests cover only ASCII alt cases.
- **FIX:** Include the multi-byte lead in the alt-prefixed set and decode the following cluster as the chord. Add a non-ASCII alt case to `InputReaderTest`.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** yes for any user whose keybindings use Alt with a non-ASCII key; sugar-crush's own defaults are ASCII.

### 4. [MINOR] `Program::withRecorder()` mutates `$this` and returns `$this`, unlike its siblings
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed 3b64097f7 + 24b401bd8 — `setRecorder():void` shipped; the `@deprecated` `withRecorder()` shim is retained for candy-vcr consumers (shim rationale truth-flipped 9bd59d808).
- **WHERE:** `candy-core/src/Program.php:178-183`. `withLogger()` and `withExceptionHandler()` at `:205-223` clone.
- **WHAT:** Breaks the repo rule that every `with*()` returns a new instance, and is inconsistent with the two adjacent setters in the same class, so a caller has to know which one lies.
- **FIX:** Make it clone like its siblings, or rename to `setRecorder()` to stop advertising fluent semantics.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** no — sugar-crush does not call it.

## RE-VERIFY 2026-10-08 (campaign rerun) — lane A1

- **N1 ✅ Descriptor-sink census red at master — CI blocker fixed (365b4ba4e, this lane).** The
  sugar-crush merges 30f61cb3a/b0f62f399 moved twenty `->close()`/`->fcntl()` sites into
  `DescriptorSinkArgumentCensusTest`'s scanned path with no roster rows; both census tests went red
  (1241T/28626A/**2F**). Re-derived honestly: every site opened and read, one judged row each —
  sixteen NOT-A-LIBC-CALLs (Ws status-code closes, session releases, LSP didClose, a
  first-class-callable registration that is not a call), four genuine libc fds judged CORRECT
  (Daemonize's dup2 spares, the two `/proc/self/fd` scanners whose `(int)` casts digit strings, not
  resources). The four argument shapes the classifier cannot name pass only through a new
  earned-absence door: the roster row must exist, claim UNCLASSIFIED, and open with 'NOT A LIBC
  CALL'. Two of them (lone string literal, variable-rooted ternary) are pinned to UNCLASSIFIED by
  the test's own liveness controls, so teaching the classifier would have meant unpinning the
  controls — the exemption path is the honest one. Any new unnamed site still reds. Suite after:
  1242T/28693A/0F/25S exit 0, assertions up (+64 from the kind-equality arm judging the new rows),
  tests not down.
- **N2 ⏭ Windows signal machinery — ruling RECORDED, NOT wired.** `WindowsBackend::drainSignals()`,
  `onResize()` and `InterruptFlags` have zero production callers, so a native-Windows `Program` gets
  no terminal resize and no Ctrl+C handling; behind them sit known dormant sub-defects —
  any-key-counts-as-interrupt fallback (`WindowsBackend.php:366-386`), a leaked `CONIN$` handle
  (`:189`), and the `InterruptFlags` singleton staying permanently dead after `destroy()` (`:498`,
  `InterruptFlags.php:146`). Rationale for not wiring here: this is a Linux box, and the wiring's
  linchpin cannot even exist on a shipping runtime — `Kernel32::setConsoleCtrlHandler()` gates on
  `FFI::dynamicFunction()`, which no released PHP provides, so today the registration path returns
  false on every OS. A fake-FFI seam test would go green here while proving nothing about the OS
  callback that is the entire point; that is speculative plumbing, refused. When a real PHP FFI
  closure-callback API lands (or a Windows CI leg can drive `GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent` end-to-end),
  wire the trio, fix the three sub-defects above in the same stroke, and start from the now-safe
  `Kernel32` registration in N4 (its trampoline retention is the prerequisite the future wiring
  would otherwise have re-discovered as a use-after-free).
- **N3 ✅ `restoreLast()` rescue apply→restore (4f6a2c487, this lane).** The second-call branch called
  `apply()` on the `Termios::current()` snapshot — a silent no-op on the `stty` fallback host
  (`SttyTermios::apply()` guards `!$this->raw` and a snapshot is never raw), leaving the terminal
  stuck in raw mode after exit: the same defect class the sibling path at `PosixBackend.php:712`
  documents as fixed. One-word fix plus the law cited at the call site. A real-pty stty pin is
  impossible from a probe child (`runStty` pipes fd 0, so `-F /dev/fd/0` names the pipe — a
  candy-pty property, disclosed); the deterministic pin shipped instead injects a recording
  snapshot via reflection and demands `restore()` was called and `apply()` was not —
  mutation-proven: reverting the fix reddens exactly that test.
- **N4 ✅ `Kernel32` ctrl-handler retention + `toWideString` ownership truth (fc1ad93f0, this lane).**
  (a) `setConsoleCtrlHandler()` handed Windows a raw function pointer and dropped the only PHP
  reference to the owning trampoline CData — a registered handler became a use-after-free at first
  Ctrl event; the trampoline and its closure are now retained in a never-pruned static. (b) An
  honest NOT-YET-INTEGRATED comment marks the method's dormancy per N2. (c) `toWideString()`'s
  docblock ordered callers to `FFI::free()` a GC-managed non-owned buffer — following that
  instruction would itself be the bug; the prose now matches the real ownership (the sole caller
  already had the right behaviour).

# candy-mosaic

### 1. [MAJOR] Half-block transparency is inverted, and fully-transparent cells paint default-foreground stripes — **LEAD-VERIFIED**
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed e5f60c4f6 — both-transparent emits a space, top-transparent emits `fgRgb(bot)` + `▄`; 8 byte pins (crush-side pins re-verified against it in 79f62ed95).
- **WHERE:** `candy-mosaic/src/Renderer/HalfBlockRenderer.php:62-71`. Class docblock `:23-29` states the mapping backwards from the code.
- **WHAT:** Verified by reading `:60-84`. `▀` (U+2580) paints its **upper** half with the foreground and `▄` (U+2584) its **lower** half with the foreground.
  - `:62-65` both-transparent emits a bare `▀` with no SGR, so the upper half renders in the terminal's *default foreground* — a visible stripe over whatever the transcript already drew. It should emit a space.
  - `:66-71` top-transparent uses `Ansi::bgRgb($botR,$botG,$botB)` with `▄`. `▄`'s lower half takes the *foreground*, so the image colour lands in the wrong half and the upper half renders default white. It should be `fgRgb`.
  - `:72-77` bottom-transparent (`fgRgb` + `▀`) is correct.
- **PROOF GAP:** the test that supposedly pins this, `candy-mosaic/tests/Renderer/HalfBlockTransparentTest.php:29-63`, only asserts `assertStringContainsString("▀")` — it cannot detect either defect. Confirm with a `bin2hex()` dump of a 2-row image with a transparent top pixel.
- **FIX:** `:65` emit `' '`; `:69` use `Ansi::fgRgb(...)`; correct the docblock at `:23-29`; strengthen the test to assert the exact SGR+glyph bytes for all four branches.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** yes. This is the fallback renderer on every non-graphics terminal and `sugar-crush/src/Renderer.php:4855` inlines its output into the frame.

### 2. [MINOR] Kitty graphics: compression is declared with the format key, and both in-repo sides agree on the wrong one
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed 7bae64b94 — compression sent as `o=z`, `f` kept as format; the candy-mosaic encoder and candy-testing decoder/fixture/pin were corrected in ONE coordinated commit.
- **WHERE:** `candy-mosaic/src/Renderer/KittyRenderer.php:101-110` with `KittyOptions.php:99-115`; the counterpart is `candy-testing/.../KittyStream.php:331-341`.
- **WHAT:** A zlib-deflated payload is sent as `f=1`. Per the Kitty spec `f` is the data *format* (1 = raw RGBA) and compression is `o=z`. candy-testing's own decoder inflates when it sees `f=1`, so the encoder and the in-repo decoder are mutually consistent and the test suite passes, while a real Kitty terminal would read compressed bytes as raw RGBA and render garbage.
- **FIX:** Send `o=z` for compression and keep `f` as the format. The candy-testing decoder must be corrected in the same change or the pair will keep passing against each other.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** no today — `withCompression()` has no sugar-crush caller, so this is a public-API landmine rather than a live defect.

**Coverage note:** `ImageLayer`, `MosaicBuilder`, `DiskCache`, `AdaptiveImage`, `PrecomputedImage`,
`Animation/AnimationDriver`, `ApngDecoder`, `Scale`, `CellSize` and `Deadline` were not reached
before the agent's budget ran out. `ImageLayer` is on sugar-crush's hot path and is the priority gap.

# candy-mouse

### 1. [MAJOR] `ZoneClickTracker` resolves a release against the press's stored zone box, so a re-render between press and release can fire a different control
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed cdcd550be — `ZoneClickTracker` fresh-hit agreement gate (a release must re-agree on id AND box); zero API change; crush click suites proven immune.
- **WHERE:** `candy-mouse/src/ZoneClickTracker.php:83` (pairs the release against the press's recorded zone/box). Consumer: `sugar-crush/src/Chat.php:7869-7957`.
- **WHAT:** sugar-crush dispatches on `$click->zone->id`, and its ids are positional per frame (`session-row:<n>`, `picker-item:<n>`). If the transcript or picker re-renders between button-down and button-up — which it does, since ticks and streamed tokens repaint — the id now names a different row, and the action fires for a control that is no longer at that position. In an app whose clickable set includes permission grants this is the dangerous class of bug.
- **STATUS: not traced to a confirmed mis-fire.** Settling it needs the probe the agent could not run: press on zone A, re-scan with A moved, release on A's old box, inspect the returned `Zone`.
- **FIX:** Carry a per-frame epoch in `ClickResult` and have the consumer drop a release whose epoch is not the current frame's; or resolve by identity rather than by positional id at dispatch.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** yes, if reproducible — this is the highest-value thing to probe in this report.

### 2. [MAJOR] The zone sentinel is a fixed, guessable literal; neutralising it is left entirely to the consumer
- **STATUS ⏭ 2026-10-07:** REJECTED — mitigations already shipped (`scanRoot` strips, lone-sentinel consumption, zone-id whitelist); a per-process nonce ripples 3 libs; the sentinel trust boundary is documented in `Sentinel.php` in the same commit cdcd550be.
- **WHERE:** `candy-mouse/src/Sentinel.php:31-34`; consumer-side stripping at `sugar-crush/src/Renderer.php:1543,4175,4215` via `Sanitize::stripZoneSentinels` (`candy-core/src/Util/Sanitize.php:80,83`).
- **WHAT:** Because the sentinel is a constant string with no per-process nonce, text that happens to contain it — including model-authored or file-sourced text rendered into a frame — is parsed as a zone marker. sugar-crush defends against this by stripping at three call sites; candy-mouse ships no first-party neutralisation and no test asserting that a forged sentinel inside content is inert. A fourth render path that forgets the strip silently reintroduces it.
- **FIX:** Give the sentinel a per-process random component so untrusted content cannot reproduce it by accident, and add a candy-mouse test that scans content containing the sentinel shape.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** yes — sugar-crush renders untrusted model output, and its safety currently rests on three hand-maintained strip calls rather than on the library.

### 3. [MINOR] `SelectionRange::extract()` is not clamped to the current frame height
- **STATUS ⏭ 2026-10-07:** disproved — unclamped trailing rows are absorbed by the renderers' blank-trims; test-only absorption pin added in cdcd550be.
- **WHERE:** `candy-mouse/src/SelectionRange.php` (`$lines[$row - 1] ?? ''`), with `Selection`'s region frozen at construction.
- **WHAT:** A selection that survives a resize copies blanks instead of being clamped to the new frame.
- **FIX:** Clamp on extract, or have `Selection` re-derive its region per frame.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** possible via `Tui/TextSelection` across a terminal resize; the agent did not finish reading whether the adapter re-clamps per render.

# candy-shine

### 1. [MAJOR] Streaming markdown repaints the open tail in full every frame, and sections only ever close at a column-0 heading
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed crush-side f3aaa7100 — incremental tail memo in sugar-crush `Renderer::streamingMarkdown` (pre-fix quadratic cost measured 0.235s→11.73s over 1k→8k tokens); shine-side section-splitting ⏭ DECLINED — would change section-split semantics for every consumer; the measured surviving cost was idle repaints of open fences, now memoized; shine's stream()==render() law untouched.
- **WHERE:** `candy-shine/src/Render/SectionScanner.php:148-169` (boundaries emitted only for ATX headings at column 0), `candy-shine/src/Render/SectionStream.php:120-146`, consumer `sugar-crush/src/Renderer.php:4279-4330` with the re-render at `:4329`.
- **WHAT:** `Renderer::streamingMarkdown()` keeps one `SectionStream` alive in a static memo, pushes each delta one line at a time, and re-renders the still-open tail on every frame via `(clone $stream)->finish()`. Because the scanner only closes a section at a column-0 heading, a long reply that is one fenced code block, or plain prose with no headings, never closes — so cost grows quadratically in tokens on the hottest path in the app. `sugar-crush/src/Renderer.php:4275-4277` documents this as accepted.
- **FIX:** Either close sections on other block boundaries (fence end, blank-line paragraph break) so the tail stays small, or make the tail render incremental. `defersStreaming()` (`candy-shine/src/Renderer.php:355`) is the existing escape hatch and is worth checking before inventing a new one.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** yes — every streamed assistant message. Needs a timing probe (render a 5k-token heading-free reply and plot per-frame cost) to size it.

### 2. [MINOR] `DiffGutter` justifies a setting with a `Width` fact that is no longer true
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed 79f62ed95 — comment-only sugar-crush-side truth-fix of the tab cite as prescribed (measured `Width::string("\t")` is 4; the `lineNumbers:false` conclusion unchanged).
- **WHERE:** `sugar-crush/src/Tui/DiffGutter.php:35` claims `Width::string("\t")` is 0. `candy-core/src/Util/Width.php:52-76` records that as pre-E69 behaviour; a tab now costs `TAB_WIDTH = 4`.
- **WHAT:** The conclusion (`lineNumbers: false`) is still right, because `candy-shine/src/SyntaxHighlighter.php:65` joins with a literal `"\t"` whose real width is column-dependent — but the stated reason is stale, and a future reader will re-derive from it and get the wrong answer.
- **FIX:** Restate the comment against current `Width` behaviour. sugar-crush-side edit, not a candy-shine one.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** documentation only.

# candy-forms

### 1. [MAJOR] `TextArea` never wraps, and measures codepoints rather than display cells
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed 88eb152b5 — cell-accurate soft-wrap in `view()` plus `visualColumn()` caret metric; `width<=0` stays byte-identical legacy.
- **WHERE:** `candy-forms/src/TextArea/TextArea.php` — `$width` is stored and `view()` never uses it to wrap.
- **WHAT:** Two separate defects on the same widget: long content does not wrap at the configured width, and caret column arithmetic counts codepoints, so the caret sits at the wrong x for any text containing wide or emoji characters. sugar-crush's session-title and rename editors are the reachable surfaces.
- **FIX:** Wrap in `view()` against `$width` via `Width::wrapAnsi`, and derive caret column from `Width::string()` of the text before the caret.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** yes — `SettingsEditor`, `SessionPicker::startRename`, `Chat` title editor.
- **NOTE:** because `sugar-bits` and `sugar-prompt` alias these classes, both fixes propagate to every façade consumer.

### 2. [MINOR] `TextInput::paste()` bypasses the restrict pattern
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed e5ea63553 — restrict is evaluated per codepoint on paste.
- **WHERE:** `candy-forms/src/TextInput/TextInput.php:939-943` (inserts the whole payload) with the check at `:1002` (`preg_match` over the entire insert).
- **WHAT:** Restrict is evaluated as an any-substring match against the pasted blob, so `4<script>` satisfies a `[0-9]` restrict.
- **FIX:** Match per-character, or anchor with `^...$` over the full candidate.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** no — grep of `sugar-crush/src` for `withRestrict|withValidator|withEnum` returns zero hits; crush uses only `withPrompt`/`withCharLimit`/`setValue`.

### 3. [MINOR] `Confirm`'s docblock advertises `Tab` toggling that `update()` does not implement
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed c4e3029fb — the advertised `Tab` toggle arm shipped.
- **WHERE:** `candy-forms/src/Field/Confirm.php:19-21` versus the `match` at `:127-139`, which has no `Tab` arm. **LEAD-VERIFIED.**
- **FIX:** Add the `Tab` arm or delete the claim.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** documentation.

### 4. [MINOR] `get*()` accessors on the field classes
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed b401111d6 — bare accessor aliases shipped with class-local `@deprecated` on `get*`; `Field`-interface method names NOT renamed (breaking, ruled out).
- **WHERE:** `Field/Confirm.php:171-173`, `TextArea/TextArea.php:793,796,803`, `TextInput/TextInput.php:591,622`.
- **WHAT:** The repo rule is bare accessors. Renaming is a breaking change for every façade consumer, so it needs a deprecation pass rather than a sweep.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** no (crush calls `value()`/`key()`).

**Also checked here:** the three inconsistent validator-attach semantics (Confirm revalidates on
change, `Field\Input` validates on attach, `Field` does not) are real but unreachable from
sugar-crush, which attaches no validators. `ItemList` `LoadMoreMsg` was probed by reading for the
infinite-loop/no-advance risk and is **clean**: `Chat::handleSessionLoadMore`
(`sugar-crush/src/Chat.php:14994-15008`) widens the fetch limit and short-page handling closes the
edge, so a zero-row fetch cannot re-fire.

# sugar-mcp

Rows 1 and 2 are carried over from the 2026-10-03 edition; both were re-checked against source this
round. Rows 3-8 are new and unprobed.

### 1. [HIGH] `sugarcraft/sugar-mcp` is not on Packagist, so the published sugar-crush cannot be installed
- **STATUS ⏭ 2026-10-07:** already-fixed upstream pre-campaign — `sugarcraft/sugar-mcp` resolves on Packagist; no manifest change was needed.
- **WHERE:** `sugar-crush/composer.json:49`. Also `php tools/check-path-repos.php`, which exits 1 with `sugar-crush: missing path-repo for sugar-mcp (required transitively via sugar-crush -> sugar-mcp)`.
- **WHAT:** `https://repo.packagist.org/p2/sugarcraft/sugar-mcp~dev.json` returns 404 while `sugarcraft/sugar-crush` dev-master resolves and requires it. `composer require sugarcraft/sugar-crush` therefore cannot install. The split repo exists (`github.com/sugarcraft/sugar-mcp`, pushed by `sync-sugarcraft.yml`); only the Packagist registration is missing. Inside the monorepo the root path-repo hides this. *Carried from 2026-10-03; not re-probed this round — re-verify the Packagist 404 before acting.*
- **FIX:** Register `sugarcraft/sugar-mcp` on Packagist; the gate then passes with no manifest change. Optionally add a `sugar-mcp` row to `DESCRIPTIONS` in `scripts/bootstrap-org-repos.sh`. Neither is doable from a working tree — both need org/Packagist access.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** yes; it decides whether a Packagist install resolves at all.

### 2. [LOW] `McpMessage::errorCode()`/`errorMessage()` invent values from malformed wire errors — **re-confirmed still open at `ce0c1931e`**
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed c2252e06d — `errorCode()`/`errorMessage()` refuse to fabricate (null on malformed shapes) with a regression pin per shape; crush's `src/McpMessage.php` verified to be the ORIGINAL of the port — nothing to back-port.
- **WHERE:** `sugar-mcp/src/McpMessage.php:289` (`(int) $this->error['code']`) and `:298` (`(string) $this->error['message']`), read by `describeError()` at `sugar-mcp/src/StdioMcpServer.php:1159-1172`. The hardened twin is `sugar-crush/src/McpMessage.php:308,326`.
- **WHAT:** Third-party wire data. `{"code":"abc"}` yields `0` and `{"code":true}` yields `1`, so a refusal reports a code the server never sent; `{"message":{"x":1}}` raises `Warning: Array to string conversion` and the text becomes `"Array"`. Under an error handler that promotes warnings, `start()` throws `ErrorException`.
- **FIX:** Port `is_int($code) ? $code : null` / `is_string($message) ? $message : null` into the library with a regression test per malformed shape. Longer term, fold crush's parallel copies onto the library's.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** yes — crush's stdio path (`sugar-crush/src/MCP/StdioMcpServer.php:71,118`) wraps the library's server and formats refusals through the library's `McpMessage`.

### 3. [MAJOR] One deadline-less hung `callTool` wedges every process sharing the connection
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed crush-side 1b06c1c27 — `StdioMcpServer` `DEFAULT_TOOL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 120.0` bounds every call by default, no opt-out; README holder-wedge + `toolTimeout` documentation 555cbca51.
- **WHERE:** `sugar-mcp/src/ExchangeLock.php:248-276` (`acquire()`), `sugar-mcp/src/StdioMcpServer.php:664-667` (deadline null unless `toolTimeoutSeconds` is opted in) and `:832-847` (`exchange()` blocks in `acquire()` before doing anything).
- **WHAT:** The whole exchange runs under one `flock`. Waiters honour *their own* deadline and the server's liveness, but the **holder** is deliberately unbounded (E646: a tool call is somebody's real work). So a live-but-silent server — a stuck tool, not a crash — leaves the holder holding forever: bounded siblings time out, unbounded siblings hang. To the user the server looks dead while its process is up. `flock` waiters are also not FIFO, so even without a hang a waiter can starve. The liveness probe only rescues the *dead* server case.
- **FIX:** (a) sugar-crush-side: give forked MCP workers a default `toolTimeoutSeconds` unless a tool declares itself long-running — the library already supports it per call. (b) Document the holder-wedges-the-queue consequence in the README's "Fork safety" section; it currently documents serialisation but not this. (c) Optionally have `exchange()` surface *why* `acquire()` returned null (deadline vs dead server vs starvation) so the payload can name the hung request id.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** yes — the MCP worker pool and `ClaudeCodeMcpClient`. The LSP twin has the same shape (see #7).

### 4. [MINOR] `callTool()` can throw where the `McpServer` contract promises an `{"error": …}` payload
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed 07638ba1c — oversized frames are refused as an error payload and the poisoned buffer is dropped (framing reset), connection kept up; the `onWait`-throw half was contracted/not-a-bug.
- **WHERE:** contract at `sugar-mcp/src/McpServer.php:57-61`; the `try` at `sugar-mcp/src/StdioMcpServer.php:670-686` catches only `\InvalidArgumentException`; escapes come from the 64 MiB frame cap at `:1335` and from a caller-supplied `onWait` closure invoked at `:1241,1253`.
- **WHAT:** An oversized or pathological server reply, or a throwing `onWait` beat, propagates a `RuntimeException` through `callTool()` into the model-facing transcript path — exactly the consumer the interface says is protected from throws.
- **FIX:** Guard the framing-cap throw separately (after a cap trip the buffer is poisoned: reset it or mark the connection dead), wrap the `onWait` invocation so a throwing beat degrades to a failed call, or amend the interface doc to name both throwing paths.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** yes, tool-result rendering.

### 5. [MINOR] `claim()` has no two-owner guard, so the fork-safety promise holds only while exactly one process ever claims
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed 2eee1a136 — `claim():bool` refuses to displace a live owner; crush sites fresh-construct and are unaffected.
- **WHERE:** `sugar-mcp/src/RequestIdSequence.php:68-71` (`claim()` sets `ownerPid` unconditionally) and `:98-110` (the plain-int branch keys solely off `$pid === $this->ownerPid`). Callers: `StdioMcpServer.php:340`, `sugar-crush/src/LSP/LspConnection.php:290`, `sugar-crush/src/MCP/HttpMcpServer.php:111`.
- **WHAT:** A process that forks a *started* connection and re-runs its connect/`claim()` in the child produces two owners each holding a copy of the parent's counter, both emitting plain decimal ids. Sharing one connection (one HTTP session id, one LSP pipe) then collides ids and a reply can be matched to the wrong call. The library's own stdio flow self-protects — a child's inherited copy reports "already running" (`StdioMcpServer.php:328`) — but the downstream twins carry no such protection.
- **FIX:** Make the handover explicit: `claim()` returns `false` or throws when the previous `ownerPid` is alive and not the current pid, leaving `claimAfterOwnerDeath()` for the legitimate restart case. Or document that consumers sharing one connection across forks must never re-claim.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** reachable in principle through `HttpMcpServer`/`LspConnection`; the agent could not run the `pcntl_fork` probe that would settle it.

### 6. [MINOR] Null-id and batch replies are skipped silently, so a deadline-less call waits forever on a non-conforming server
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed e563f0fc5 — skip-strike tripwire (threshold 8) fails the exchange on junk frames; foreign-id late answers exempt.
- **WHERE:** `sugar-mcp/src/McpMessage.php:54-92` (`{"id":null}` parses to `id = null`; a top-level JSON array fails the `jsonrpc` check at `:61` and returns `null`), `:268` (`isResponse()` requires `id !== null`), and the skip-by-design reader policy at `sugar-mcp/src/StdioMcpServer.php:1054-1096`.
- **WHAT:** The malformed-reply gate `isMalformedReplyTo()` (`:1096`) can only fire for a frame carrying *our* id, so a null-id or array frame never reaches it. For a bounded call the deadline saves the caller; for the default unbounded `callTool()` it waits on a reply that will never be attributed — indistinguishable from finding #3.
- **FIX:** A conformance tripwire: while an exchange is outstanding, count frames that parse to `null` or carry `id === null` with a result/error shape and fail the exchange with an `{"error": …}` after a small threshold.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** only against misbehaving servers; conforming SDK servers never send these shapes.

### 7. [MINOR] `LspExchangeLock` duplicates `ExchangeLock`, so library hardening must be re-landed by hand
- **STATUS ⏭ 2026-10-07:** re-characterized — no defect (the LSP store uses atomic temp+rename); the twin is acknowledged in the README via 555cbca51 and stays a backlog fold item.
- **WHERE:** `sugar-crush/src/LSP/LspExchangeLock.php` (wired `LspConnection.php:72,313`) versus `sugar-mcp/src/ExchangeLock.php`.
- **WHAT:** The library's fail-closed gates (`store()`/`markPhase()` returning `false` aborts the exchange — `ExchangeLock.php:314,340`; `sweepStale()` on every `new()` — `:89-95`) have no parity test, so each must be noticed and re-applied in the twin.
- **FIX:** Parameterise `ExchangeLock` with the note/append API the LSP side needs so it can use the canonical class, or add a parity test asserting the twin behaves identically.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** yes — LSP crash recovery.

### 8. [MINOR] Test gaps
- **STATUS ⏭ 2026-10-07:** audit row stale — expiry-while-held is already covered by `ExchangeLockTest:107-124`.
- **WHERE:** `sugar-mcp/tests/`.
- **WHAT:** no test exercises `acquire()` expiring **while the holder is alive** — the exact #3 scenario, so the mitigation surface is unpinned; `RequestIdSequence` is pinned only through a pid seam (real-fork coverage lives one level up in `StdioMcpServerForkSafetyTest`); `McpMessageTest` (177 lines) was not opened, so null-id/error-shape tolerance is unverified.
- **FIX:** Add the deadline-expiry-while-alive test first, then a fork test for `claim()`.

**Clean bill (sugar-mcp):** NDJSON framing is solid on every hostile input the agent could construct
statically — `json_encode` escapes control characters so a payload cannot forge a frame boundary,
CRLF and blank lines are trimmed, split and coalesced reads are handled by the floor-offset scan
(`StdioMcpServer.php:1118-1125`, O(n) via `$scannedFrom`), the 64 MiB cap drops rather than
truncates, stderr is drained on both wait sets so a full pipe cannot deadlock the child. Correlation
happy path, `ArgumentShape` (bounded by `MAX_DEPTH 64` / `VISIT_BUDGET 10000`, 16-hop `$ref` cap, no
injection path found from untrusted `inputSchema`), `McpRouter` deny-before-allow ordering, and
live-process child teardown (`BoundedShutdown` TERM→KILL→reap, group-aware) all checked out.
`tools/check-child-lifetimes.php` was **not run** (Bash denied) — treat as blocked, not clean.

## RE-VERIFY 2026-10-08 (campaign rerun) — lane A2

- **P1 ✅ McpMessage twin folded into the library — (449298e62, this lane).** The probe verdict that
  crush's copy was the *original with more machinery* held: the D12 wire-id superset
  (`parsePreservingId`/`withWireId`/`MAX_DEPTH`) plus the mixed-typed `error()` data carrier migrated
  into `sugar-mcp/src/McpMessage.php` with every library wire law preserved (`params:[]`→`stdClass`,
  encode failures wrapped in `InvalidArgumentException` naming the method), crush's 424-line twin and
  its canonical unit suite deleted per the façade rule — the moved pins (id-preserving round-trips,
  the 13-type result matrix, wire-shape census, widened malformed-member loops re-fed as raw JSON
  literals because `json_encode` on this host collapses `-32601.0` to int text) now live with the
  canonical class; crush keeps only consumer-level e2e rows. Library suite 184T/668A → 226T/899A.
- **P2 ✅ McpRouter law folded, product adapter kept — (bdc13dea0, this lane).** The library absorbs
  crush's `serverDenied` static verbatim (instance path delegates, so the raw-key, string-pattern,
  non-empty doctrine is the only spelling that exists) and crush's fail-loud allowlist wording;
  `sugar-crush/src/MCP/McpRouter.php` survives as a 16/82 thin adapter mapping `AgentPreset` →
  allowList (product policy: preset scoping, crush-`McpServer` tool merge, names-list shape). The
  numeric-pattern-key behavior flip (int keys no longer match through the routed view) is crush's
  canonical doctrine, pinned both ways in the library tests. Law-duplicate crush rows retired
  (McpRouterTest 14T→4T adapter pins); the PathGlob census docblock moved in-step 291,596→289,440.
- **P3 ✅ Stdio twins recorded already-folded — (a9228639c, this lane).** No code change: the probe
  confirmed crush's `StdioMcpServer` is the intentional PHASE-2a product adapter over the library
  transport, and its header now states the two product seams that justify the surviving file —
  `spawnPlanner`/`clientInfo` wiring, the per-call `DEFAULT_TOOL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 120.0` ceiling
  (no library counterpart; `toolTimeout` tunes, never disables), and the secret-scrub spawn policy.
- **P4 ⏭ LspExchangeLock fold skipped with rationale — (4ea791720, this lane).** Diverged by
  reason: crush's lock is a 3-file state/frame/notes-journal model for LSP exchange recovery, the
  library's `ExchangeLock` a single-file phase-byte claim; merging would force a general file-set
  abstraction onto the library for zero user benefit. The disposition is recorded in the class
  docblock, shared laws restated there rather than factored into a base — dual maintenance of those
  sentences is the accepted cost. `ReadPathCensus` rows untouched, as the skip implies no move.
- **W-1 ✅ HttpMcpServerTest dot-sidecar leak closed — (47c91f1f3, this lane).** The probe-time
  finding (4 warnings, exit 1 under `--filter Mcp`) was the test unlinks only `auth.json.lock` while
  candy-core's `AtomicJsonFile` keeps its lock in the dot-sidecar `.auth.json.lock`, and its outer
  gate skipped cleanup entirely when the payload file was absent. tearDown now tolerates each
  leftover independently; post-fix a fresh run plants zero `/tmp/e695_http_*` residue (305
  historical leaks before), and the crush Mcp filter closes at 1056T/5168A/**0 warnings**/exit 0.
- **D-1 ✅ README timeout wording matches shipped reality — (4bdb94192, this lane).** README:2071
  still advertised `tools/call` as unbounded-by-default long after 1b06c1c27 shipped the 120 s
  default; the clause now cites `StdioMcpServer::DEFAULT_TOOL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` semantics (unset or
  non-positive → 120.0, per-entry `toolTimeout` raises, never disables), pointing at docs/MCP.md
  which already carried the truth. No documentation-drift guard pinned the stale sentence (grepped
  before editing; the DocFigure timeout arm cites `Chat::PARALLEL_TOOL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, a
  different constant, untouched).

**Suite-figure seam (lane A2):** the crush Mcp-filter folds moved test *runs* across lib boundaries
without touching `sugar-crush/tests/Config/Support/suite-figure.json` — the campaign's final re-pin
commits carry that, alongside the known-red ReadmeSuiteFigureDrift staleness pair (pinned 21,196).

# sugar-toast

sugar-crush imports nothing from this library and names every symbol by inline FQN. The complete
reached surface: `Toast::new(56)->withDuration(null)->withSymbolSet(SymbolSet::Unicode)->alert(...)`
at `sugar-crush/src/Chat.php:9226-9229`, `ToastType::Warning/Success/Info` at `:9117-9119,9158`, and
`->view('', $width, 0)` at `sugar-crush/src/Renderer.php:6495`. **Every FQN resolves** — no contract
divergence. The inline spelling is house style in those two very large files, not drift; for
`Position` there is additionally a genuine clash with `SugarCraft\Veil\Position` imported at
`Renderer.php:28`.

**Correction to this round's tasking**, recorded because the premise was wrong in the prompt:
sugar-toast *is* integration-tested — `sugar-crush/tests/Chat/ApplySettingsTest.php:177-199` asserts
the toast text renders, that per-row width never exceeds terminal columns, and the generation
semantics; `CompactionLiveSettingsTest.php:284` also exercises it. So there is no coverage gap on
the reached surface.

### 1. [MAJOR] `dismiss()` is a one-way trap; `clear()` does not undo it
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed c5cce07d7 — `clear()` resets `dismissed`; writing to a dismissed toast raises `LogicException`; dismiss→clear→alert→view revival pin shipped.
- **WHERE:** `sugar-toast/src/Toast.php:315` (flag set), `:471` (`view()` short-circuits on it), `:334-339` (`clear()` empties the queue but not the flag); `README.md:131`.
- **WHAT:** After one `dismiss()` call that instance can never render again — subsequent `alert()`s queue invisibly forever. There is no `withDismissed(false)`. The README explicitly tells hosts to retire persistent alerts via `dismiss()`, `clear()` or `pruneExpired()`, and `dismiss()` is the only one that records history *and* the only one that bricks the object.
- **PROOF GAP:** `ToastEscCloseTest.php:75-81` documents the split brain in a comment, but no test renders, re-alerts or clears *after* a dismiss.
- **FIX:** Have `clear()` reset `dismissed`, or add `withDismissed(bool)`; add a `dismiss → clear → alert → view` regression test.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** no — `applySettings()` replaces the whole toast (`Chat.php:9226`) and never calls `dismiss()`. Latent.

### 2. [MAJOR] Unbounded accumulation by default; `view()` never frees expired alerts
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed c5cce07d7 — prune-on-write, `dismiss` MOVES alerts to history instead of double-counting, `withHistoryLimit` default 100.
- **WHERE:** `sugar-toast/src/Toast.php:49` (`maxConcurrent = null`), `:251-267` (`appendBounded` caps nothing when null), `:475-477` (expiry filter), `:304-317` (`dismiss`), `HistoryLog.php:25-28`.
- **WHAT:** Three defaults compose badly: no concurrency cap; `view()` filters expired alerts into a **local** `$active` and, being immutable, never writes the filtered set back, so expired alerts stay in `$queue` forever and nothing inside the library calls `pruneExpired()`; and `HistoryLog::push` is uncapped while `dismiss()` copies live alerts into it *and* leaves them in the queue, double-counting until pruned.
- **FIX:** Return a drained instance alongside `view()` (or make the rendered set authoritative), default `maxConcurrent` to a finite number, add `withHistoryLimit(int|null)`.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** no — crush toasts only on settings save, one persistent alert replaced wholesale, so the tight-loop-of-failures premise has no crush path. Latent for any long-lived host.

### 3. [MINOR] Forked `nextCluster()` lacks the invalid-UTF-8 guards `candy-core`'s canonical version has
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed c5cce07d7 — candy-core's invalid-UTF-8 guards ported verbatim into the fork; `Width::nextCluster` promotion noted as follow-up.
- **WHERE:** `sugar-toast/src/Toast.php:774-792` versus `candy-core/src/Util/Width.php:847-884`.
- **WHAT:** Toast's private cluster walker accepts `grapheme_extract()`'s return unconditionally. ICU, on malformed input, returns the *next* cluster (skipping the stray byte) or a substituted U+FFFD; `Width::nextCluster` learned this and now rejects clusters not positioned at the cursor plus validates the lead byte's continuation bytes. `candy-core/tests/Util/WidthInvalidUtf8Test.php:18-23` records the bug that fix closed ("every cluster walk duplicated one cluster and dropped the bad byte"). Toast forked the walker before that fix and never re-synced — which also breaks its own `CALIBER_LEARNINGS.md` instruction to delegate to `Width`.
- **FIX:** Delete the fork and call `Width::nextCluster()`, or port both guards verbatim; mirror `WidthInvalidUtf8Test::malformed()` into the toast suite.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** low — crush's alert texts are fixed strings plus settings paths.

### 4. [MINOR] README shows a call chain that fatals
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed c5cce07d7 — README example corrected to the `actions:`-parameter chain.
- **WHERE:** `sugar-toast/README.md:253-255`.
- **WHAT:** `$toast->alert(...)->withActions([$action])` throws "Call to undefined method Toast::withActions()" — `withActions()` exists only on `Alert` (`Alert.php:90`). The prior plan's Phase 4.4 asked for exactly this fix; the code grew an `actions:` parameter on `alert()`/`progressToast()` (`Toast.php:175,199`) and the example was never corrected.
- **FIX:** `$toast->alert(ToastType::Error, 'Connection lost', actions: [$action])`.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** documentation.

### 5. [MINOR] `Action::make()` violates the `::new()`-only factory rule
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed c5cce07d7 — `Action::new()` (8 sites).
- **WHERE:** `sugar-toast/src/Action.php:30`, with no `new()` twin.
- **FIX:** Rename to `Action::new()`, or alias `new()` and deprecate `make()`.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** no — crush never touches `Action`.

### 6. [INFO] `withOverflow()` docblock contradicts the property default
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed c5cce07d7 — docblock truth-flipped: `DropOldest` is the default.
- **WHERE:** `sugar-toast/src/Toast.php:246` says "Enqueue (the default)"; `:52` is `Overflow::DropOldest` (matching README and `CALIBER_LEARNINGS.md`). One-word doc fix.

**Clean bill (sugar-toast):** the brief's top-risk hypothesis — armed timers left on the shared
ReactPHP loop — has **no surface here**: greps over `src/` and `lang/` for
`Loop|React|timer|proc_open|getenv|POSIX` return zero hits. Expiry is pure wall-clock
(`Alert::isExpired()`, `Alert.php:35-39`); crush's single `Cmd::tick(6.0)` is host-side and
generation-guarded (`Chat.php:1764-1767`), which is the right pattern. No POSIX calls, so nothing to
audit on portability. All 9 src files have `declare(strict_types=1)`, public classes `final`, bare
accessors, enums for `Position`/`SymbolSet`/`ToastType`/`Overflow`; every `with*()` returns a fresh
clone (`ToastEscCloseTest.php:31-38`, `AlertTest.php:160`). `view('', $w, 0)` with height 0 is safe —
canvas height is `max(max(bg,0), stackHeight)` (`Toast.php:505`). `nextExpiry()` vs
`secondsUntilNextExpiry()` are correctly distinguished. 23 test files cover essentially every public
method; the only real gaps are the two dismiss cases in #1.

RE-VERIFY 2026-10-08 (campaign rerun) — gate (sugar-toast; final undispositioned audit section, re-verified against source at this tip):
- **Item 1 [dismiss one-way trap, MAJOR] — ✅ LANDED confirmed.** `clear()` resets `dismissed` (`Toast.php:405`), every write path (`appendBounded` :296) refuses a dismissed instance with a `LogicException` naming `clear()`, and the revival pin `testDismissThenClearThenAlertRendersAgain` plus three refuse-pins live in `ToastDismissLifecycleTest` — exactly the PROOF GAP the audit named.
- **Item 2 [unbounded accumulation, MAJOR] — ✅ LANDED confirmed.** Prune-on-write inside `appendBounded` (:303-306, expired leave on every enqueue, not only at `view()`); `dismiss()` MOVES live alerts to history (:375-381, `testDismissMovesLiveAlertsOutOfTheQueue` + repeated-dismiss no-double-count pin); `withHistoryLimit` ships with default 100 (:67,:167) threaded through `HistoryLog::push`. `maxConcurrent` default stays null by design with the growth caveat stated honestly in the property docblock (:56).
- **Item 3 [forked nextCluster, MINOR] — ✅ LANDED, SUPERSEDED STRONGER.** The STATUS row's "ported verbatim into the fork" is one commit behind history: @793d9d959 deleted the fork body entirely once `Width::nextCluster` was promoted public (`candy-core/src/Util/Width.php:855`) — `Toast.php:851` is now a one-line delegation, guards live in exactly one place. Malformed-walk pins mirrored from core: `ToastNextClusterInvalidUtf8Test` (byte-for-byte reproduction, broken-sequence non-swallow, stray-lead yields itself).
- **Item 4 [README fatal chain, MINOR] — ✅ LANDED confirmed.** `README.md:259` shows the `actions:`-parameter chain; the chain also uses `Action::new` (item 5).
- **Item 5 [`Action::make()`, MINOR] — ✅ LANDED confirmed.** `Action.php:31` declares `public static function new(...)`; no `make()` remains anywhere in src/ or README.
- **Item 6 [overflow docblock lie, INFO] — ✅ LANDED confirmed.** `Toast.php:288` now reads "(DropOldest is the default)", matching the property default at :64.
- **Coverage-rows reconciliation (the two test-addition rows):** the "Unaudited libraries: 7 transitive-only deps" row is discharged by lanes A3a/A3b — all seven (buffer/ansi/async/input/palette/flip/honey-bounce) audited with fixes and new pin files on disk (e.g. `candy-buffer/tests/WideCellPairingTest.php`, `candy-async/tests/CancellationSourceTest.php`). The "candy-mosaic unaudited surface" row is discharged by lane A4 — `DeadlineTest.php` (did not exist pre-lane) plus Scale/AdaptiveImage/AnimationDriver/ImageLayer fix-pins all present in `candy-mosaic/tests/`.
- **Gates:** sugar-toast suite **278T/669A OK** (era figure, exact) linked plain-pipe, 0.63 s. Zero actionable defects found — no fix commit in this lane; nothing pushed. Evidence `/tmp/opencode/crush-libs-rerun/GATE/`.

# candy-kit

sugar-crush declares this library and reaches it from **zero** `src/` files. The deferral is
deliberate and documented, and this round confirms the record is accurate.

**Deferral status: holds.** `git show --stat ddd9560d0` is "require candy-focus and candy-kit, which
two plan items need and neither had", touching only `sugar-crush/composer.json`. The row is at
`sugar-crush/composer.json:59` (`@dev`) with the E453 `deferred-wiring` note at `:90-92`.
`tools/check-path-repos.php` keys `$deferredWiring` off that row (`:620`) and prints `DEFERRED_WIRING`
then `continue`s **before** `$unusedFindings++` (`:720-730`), so `--unused` exits 0 for it — this is
code-path evidence; the command itself was not run (Bash denied). The single test naming the
namespace, `sugar-crush/tests/Config/DocFigureProseDriftTest.php:2774`
`testCandyKitDeferredWiringRowMatchesWhatItRecords()`, is a drift guard on the deferral *record*: it
pins the row's prose against candy-kit source and finally asserts `src/` reaches candy-kit in zero
files. It is not integration and does not make the deferral a wiring. E453 is `[CLOSED]` as a CI
defect at `docs/plans/crush_code_hardening_backlog.md:15101` (resolved in the keep direction by E487,
`:16012`), while the restyle remains open — the row uses "E453" for both.

### 1. [MAJOR] candy-kit's presenters cannot express the current help page, so E453 is a content-model rewrite
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed 45b919a8e — E453 backlog doc-record: the content-model blocker (`SafeText::line()` strips newlines; adopting it reverses the help-page i18n contract) is recorded so the item is no longer costed as a restyle.
- **WHERE:** `candy-kit/src/Internal/SafeText.php:37`, used by `HelpText.php:65,68,73,107,108`, `Section.php:41,108`, `Banner.php:29-30`.
- **WHAT:** `SafeText::line()` strips `\x00-\x1f`, i.e. every newline, so a multi-line usage synopsis or any description containing a line break is silently flattened to one line. The single-line contract is deliberate — it protects the frame-diff renderer — but `sugar-crush/lang/en.php:152-533` is a 380-line page whose meaning lives in its line breaks and continuation indents (`serve`'s option block, `session pin|unpin|…`). `HelpText::render()` cannot reproduce it.
- **FIX:** For whoever picks up E453: split the catalogue into per-row keys (`sections[title][key] => description`), or add a multi-line-preserving variant. Note the collision first: `sugar-crush/src/Cli/Help.php:37-41` records the *opposite* decision (audit 15b-14 — translated as a page, column layout included, deliberately not split per-row). Adopting `HelpText` reverses an i18n contract, and that, not the test pins, is the blocker.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** no today; this is what makes the deferred work larger than a restyle.

### 2. [MINOR] `Banner::title()` takes no width
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed 45b919a8e — `Banner` gains a width parameter.
- **WHERE:** `candy-kit/src/Banner.php:24-43` sizes to content (`Style::new()->border()->padding(0,2)->render()`); `Section` and `HelpText` both accept `?int $width`.
- **WHAT:** A title wider than the terminal wraps and breaks the border box, and no caller can cap it.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** no.

### 3. [MINOR] No presenter self-resolves width, and the current help page already exceeds the default
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed 45b919a8e — honest smallest fix shipped with a TODO pointer at the wiring call-site (disclosed).
- **WHERE:** every presenter takes an explicit `?int $width` defaulting to 80 and never queries the terminal (`Section.php:96-97` says so outright); `Cli/Help.php:43` is `screen(): string` with no width to pass.
- **WHAT:** Measured: the longest current help line is 81 cells, so rendering at the 80 default already changes output. Wiring must widen the signature or resolve width at the `ArgvParser` call site.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** no today.

### 4. [MINOR] Sibling presenters disagree on a bad width
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed 45b919a8e — `HelpText` and `Section` share a `WidthGuard` for the bad-width contract.
- **WHERE:** `HelpText::assertWidth()` throws `InvalidArgumentException` for `<1` (`HelpText.php:169-176`, correct per "no silent failures"); `Section::header()` clamps negatives to empty output (`Section.php:139`, pinned by `SectionTest.php:193-194`).
- **WHAT:** One screen using both explodes in one place and blanks in the other.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** no.

### 5. [MINOR] `SafeText.php:37` swallows a PCRE failure into an empty string
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed 45b919a8e — the PCRE failure now throws, with a structural pin against reintroducing `?? ''`.
- **WHERE:** `preg_replace(...) ?? ''`.
- **WHAT:** Caller text can vanish silently where the repo requires a throw. Reachability is low (fixed character-class pattern), hence MINOR. **FIX:** `?? throw new \RuntimeException(...)`.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** no.

**SUSPECTED, unrun:** `Stage::subStepWithProgress()` picks its spinner frame from
`(int)(microtime(true)*10) % 10` (`Stage.php:117-118`) while `tests/fixtures/stage-substep-progress.golden`
is a 101-byte golden — confirm by running `--filter 'Progress|Banner'`.
- **STATUS ⏭ 2026-10-07:** no-op — kit spinner/golden interaction verified green on re-run (19/40, goldens unshifted; 45b919a8e lane).

**Clean bill (candy-kit):** all 10 classes `final`, `declare(strict_types=1)` first, no
`::create()/::make()/::default()`, no `get*()` accessors, `Frame::new()` is the root; every value-object
`with*()` returns `new self(...)` (`Frame.php:64,75,81,87`, `Logo.php:80`, `Theme.php:182`); reset
discipline sound (`Style::render` appends `Ansi::reset()`, `candy-sprinkles/src/Style.php:1050`, and
`Frame.php:213` adds one after truncation); width math is cell-aware and the old `mb_strlen` alignment
bug is pinned away (`HelpTextTest.php:71-86`); zero POSIX calls in `src/`, tty-ness delegated to
`ColorProfile::detect()` with `\defined('STDOUT')` guards (`Theme.php:123-139`). Prior audit items #1,
#2, #13, #14 and #20-#24 are all fixed in tree. `ThemeBuilder` mutating `$this` (`:25-43`) is an
`@internal` builder, not a value-object violation.

# candy-layout

The headline risk from the brief — silent divergence between the Cassowary simplex and the greedy
fallback — is **structurally impossible now**: the simplex was deleted and
`candy-layout/src/CassowarySolver.php:68-76` delegates wholly to `GreedySolver`. One solver, so no
divergent geometry. sugar-crush also never touches `GreedySolver`, `CassowarySolver` or `Constraint`
directly; it uses only `Dock\Side` and `DockLayout` (`slots`, `resolve`, `regionFor`,
`toArray`/`fromArray`, `withSlotAdded/Removed/MovedTo`, `columnShare`, `centerPaneId`, `sideMinCols`,
`centerMinCols`, `dividerCols`) plus `Region`. No contract divergence found and the Dock classes are
`final readonly` / immutable-fluent as required.
- **Two-solver/cycling premise ⏭ 2026-10-07:** re-audited premise-dead — delegation at `CassowarySolver.php:68-76`, zero MAJOR-or-worse; header note shipped in `findings/candy-layout.md` via LL-docs 3862a4657.

### 1. [MINOR] No test asserts the dock's columns sum to the frame width
- **STATUS ⏭ 2026-10-07:** skipped — out of campaign scope; the LL-docs re-audit banner (3862a4657) records the section's worst as these 3 MINORs, zero MAJOR-or-worse.
- **WHERE:** `candy-layout/tests/Dock/DockLayoutTest.php:650` sweeps **heights** 1..400; no equivalent width sweep exists.
- **WHAT:** Rounding that loses a cell per region is exactly the failure that leaves a growing gutter or clips the last pane, and it is the one invariant sugar-crush's dock depends on that nothing pins.
- **FIX:** Add the width sweep: 3-region dock, widths 1..200, assert region widths sum exactly to the frame. This is the single most valuable probe for this library and it was never run.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** yes — every pane split.

### 2. [MINOR] Per-frame re-resolve cost on the drag path
- **STATUS ⏭ 2026-10-07:** skipped — out of campaign scope; re-audit banner 3862a4657 (measure-first item never scheduled).
- **WHERE:** sugar-crush calls `resolve()` from `sideWidth`, `stackHeights` and both drag previews; `isUntouchedDefaultDock()` rebuilds `toArray()` twice per call at `sugar-crush/src/App/App.php:1403`.
- **WHAT:** Layout is recomputed continuously during a drag and on every `WindowSizeMsg` during a terminal resize.
- **FIX:** Measure first (unbounded agent budget; no timing was taken). Memoize `toArray()` in `isUntouchedDefaultDock()` if the sweep shows it mattering.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** yes, during drag/resize.

### 3. [MINOR] The only machine-sensitive arithmetic is the opt-in rounding path
- **STATUS ⏭ 2026-10-07:** skipped — out of campaign scope; re-audit banner 3862a4657 (crush never opts into `roundSplit`).
- **WHERE:** `candy-layout/src/GreedySolver.php:253-261` (`round()`/float `floor` percentage split, opt-in `roundSplit` only).
- **WHAT:** Deterministic given identical input, but it is the one place a float-to-int policy could differ across builds. `DockGeometry` also exposes `dividerColumns` as both a property and a method.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** not on crush's path (crush does not opt into `roundSplit`).

# sugar-veil

sugar-crush touches exactly two call sites, both the same shape:
`Veil::new()->withBackdrop(50)->composite($overlay, $backdrop, CENTER, CENTER[, $shift])` at
`sugar-crush/src/Renderer.php:1977` and `src/Tui/Components/AgentDashboardPane.php:262`; it also
re-implements `Position::CENTER->xOffset()/yOffset()` arithmetic itself at
`Renderer.php:6586,6627,6739`.

**The brief's premise that this path is untested is not established.** `Renderer.php:1911-1915` names
`KeyHelpTest::testTheOverlayChainPaintsInRoutingOrderRightDownTheChain()` as driving all four
overlays through this chain; the agent did not open that file, so the claim was correctly withheld.
Check it before treating veil coverage as a gap.

### 1. [MAJOR] A wide glyph straddling the overlay's clip boundary leaves half-glyph residue
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed da2fbbfcc — cell-aware suffix clip blanks the straddling backdrop cell; 7-case provider pins composited-row width.
- **WHERE:** `sugar-veil/src/Veil.php` clip path, via `candy-core/src/Util/Width::dropAnsi()` (`candy-core/src/Util/Width.php:714-721`), which consumes the whole straddling cluster.
- **WHAT:** The background cell under the split half is dropped rather than blanked, so half a glyph persists on screen. `DiffCellModelTest.php:27` covers wide glyphs in the diff model, not at the clip edge.
- **FIX:** Blank the straddling cell explicitly when the cluster is consumed by a clip. Confirm by composing a CJK-bearing backdrop under a known overlay and dumping `bin2hex()`.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** yes whenever an overlay edge lands on a wide character — CJK session titles and emoji in the transcript both qualify.

### 2. [MINOR] An overlay taller than the backdrop silently drops its own top rows
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed 2d3de05e6 — anchor `baseY` clamped to >= 0 so the overlay paints from its top; explicit negative `yOffset` stays unclamped for slide animations.
- **WHERE:** `sugar-veil/src/Position.php:39` (`yOffset()` goes negative) with the row loop starting at `fy = row - $y` in `Veil.php:520`.
- **WHAT:** The overlay's top rows — its border and title — are never painted. Latent for sugar-crush, which guards this itself (`Renderer.php:1345`, "never taller than `rows - 2`").
- **FIX:** Clamp and clip the overlay rather than skipping rows.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** no, guarded consumer-side.

### 3. [MINOR] `RenderSession` is shared by reference across every `with*()` clone
- **STATUS ⏭ 2026-10-07:** by design — docblocked as such; `withFreshSession()` hatch is the sanctioned escape.
- **WHERE:** `sugar-veil/src/Veil.php:709`.
- **WHAT:** Two clones of one veil diff against each other's frames. Harmless for sugar-crush, which builds a fresh `Veil` per render (`Renderer.php:1951-1954`).
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** no.

### 4. [INFO] `withBackdrop()` cannot dim SGR-styled rows — deliberate, and worth stating in the README
- **STATUS ⏭ 2026-10-07:** already documented — in-code at `Veil.php:604-608` and `README.md:84`; no change needed.
- **WHERE:** `sugar-veil/src/Veil.php:619` returns any ESC-leading line untouched; **LEAD-VERIFIED** and documented in-code at `:604-608` ("wrapping an escape-led line in color SGR would corrupt the payload it carries") and `README.md:84`.
- **WHAT:** An agent filed this as a probable MAJOR ("the dim the product asks for may be a near-no-op" against crush's themed, SGR-prefixed frame rows). It is not a bug — skipping escape-introducing lines is the correct guard. The residual truth is only that a backdrop dim over a fully themed frame does much less than `withBackdrop(50)` suggests, which is a documentation matter.
- **FIX:** If the dim is wanted over styled content, it needs per-cell SGR rewriting, not a line-level factor. Otherwise note the limitation next to the option.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** cosmetic.

# candy-fuzzy

**Index correctness is clean, and that was the main thing to fear.** The unit is code points end to
end and self-consistent: `MatchResult.php:18-24` states the contract, `CharFold.php:46-64` folds
per-code-point 1:1 by construction (İ→i+U+0307 stays one element),
`SmithWatermanMatcher.php:331-390` plus traceback `:667-695`, and `Highlighter.php:36-42,106-110` use
`mb_strlen`/`mb_substr` with explicit `'UTF-8'`. This is the fixed MAJOR-1 from the 2026-09-30 audit,
pinned by `CodePointExpansionTest.php:63-146`. Cost is bounded (caps 128/1000,
`SmithWatermanMatcher.php:60-63`; memory pinned under 8 MB at 1000×1000 by `SmithWatermanCapsTest.php:74-87`),
and `requireFullQuery` — the mode all four crush pickers use, e.g. `Chat.php:16659` — is
brute-force-verified against every in-order placement (`RequireFullQueryTest.php:198-247`). Ordering
is deterministic, so there is no reorder-under-the-fingers bug.

### 1. [MINOR] No test anywhere covers 4-byte (SMP/emoji) code points through matcher → highlighter
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed 4261f3eb2 — +115-case SMP/emoji matrix through matcher → highlighter; behavior was already correct, now pinned.
- **WHERE:** `candy-fuzzy/tests/` — a grep for `u{1` returns only U+1E9E (`CodePointExpansionTest.php:51,157`).
- **WHAT:** SMP characters are the one class of non-ASCII input never exercised against the path that produces the highlight offsets sugar-crush paints.
- **FIX:** Add emoji and CJK candidates to the round-trip test. Probe: match a query against a candidate containing U+1F600 and assert highlighter offsets.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** yes if a session title or command name contains an emoji.

### 2. [MINOR] Malformed UTF-8 is unhandled and can desync indices
- **STATUS ⏭ 2026-10-07:** desync disproved — variant downgraded to INFO; the `\xFF`→`?` fold is docblocked and pinned in 4261f3eb2.
- **WHERE:** `candy-fuzzy/src/Matcher/CharFold.php:54` — the `preg_match('/[\x80-\xFF]/')` fast path plus `mb_str_split`.
- **WHAT:** On invalid bytes the split and the fold can disagree, shifting every subsequent index. Session titles read off disk are the plausible source. **SUSPECTED**: confirm by matching a query against `"\xFF" . 'ab'`.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** only for corrupt on-disk state.

### 3. [MINOR] No test for duplicate candidates or input-order stability
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed 4261f3eb2 — stable-`usort` dependency stated in the docblock and pinned.
- **WHERE:** `candy-fuzzy/src/MatchResultSorter.php:26-28` relies on PHP 8's stable `usort` without saying so in a comment.
- **FIX:** State the stability dependency; a sort that stops being stable silently reorders the palette.

### 4. [INFO] The haystack tiebreak compares fully-numeric strings numerically
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed 4261f3eb2 — numeric tie-break doc-noted and pinned.
- **WHERE:** `candy-fuzzy/src/MatchResultSorter.php:27` uses `<=>`, so `"10" <=> "9"` is numeric, not byte order. Deterministic, just not lexicographic.

# candy-focus

One-file library, and the audit read all of it. sugar-crush uses 6 of 25 public methods
(`ofStrict()` `:72`, `has()`, `focus()`, `next()`, `previous()`, `current()` at
`sugar-crush/src/Tui/Pane.php:152-162`) and rebuilds the ring fresh per call from 7 constant ids
(`:70-75`). All 25 public methods have at least one test; `FocusRingTest.php` is 969 lines / 89
methods including a white-box `assertCacheConsistent()` reflection guard (`:623`) and an
incremental-cache parity sequence (`:566`). Conventions clean.

**No BLOCKER and no MAJOR here.** The desync scenarios the brief ranked first (remove the focused
item, remove before the cursor, `reorder()`, hidden-region-holds-focus) are unreachable from
sugar-crush as wired, because the ring is rebuilt rather than mutated.

### 1. [MINOR] `focus()` accepts a disabled id, while `next()`/`previous()` refuse one
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed 010c58c67 — `focus()` now refuses disabled ids, aligned with `next()`/`previous()`; the parked-focus law documented.
- **WHERE:** `candy-focus/src/FocusRing.php:239-247` checks only registration, never `$disabled`. No test covers `focus()` on a disabled region; `README.md:116` is silent on it.
- **WHAT:** Exactly the brief's "can a hidden region still hold focus?" — yes, by explicit `focus()`. A focused-but-hidden control means keystrokes go somewhere the user cannot see.
- **FIX:** Refuse or document; add the missing test.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** no (fresh ring, nothing disabled).

### 2. [MINOR] README's restore snippet indexes `[-1]` on an empty snapshot
- **STATUS ⏭ 2026-10-07:** partial — the snippet already carried the “non-empty snapshot” annotation; a hardening line shipped in the same commit 010c58c67.
- **WHERE:** `candy-focus/README.md:98-104` does `->focus($s['ids'][$s['index']])`; for an empty snapshot `index` is `-1`, an undefined offset. Guarded only by the prose "a non-empty snapshot", and `testJsonSnapshotRoundTripsThroughPublicApi` (`:938`) uses a non-empty ring.

**Also worth naming:** the live Tab/Shift-Tab keystroke path does **not** use this library at all.
`App::cyclePaneFocus()` (`sugar-crush/src/App/App.php:1682-1695`) hand-rolls
`(($index + $step) % $count + $count) % $count` over the dock-scoped order from `paneCycleOrder()`,
and `Pane.php:110-116` states this as an erratum. Two independent orderings (full strip vs dock
slots) pinned only by `PaneReverseCycleTest` is the real divergence risk in this area — larger than
anything inside `FocusRing`.

# sugar-diff

Small surface: `Diff`, `DiffOptions`, `LineKind`, all from
`sugar-crush/src/Tui/Settings/SettingsSavePreview.php:13-15,123-126,190-205` — the preview shown
before a settings write.

**The "preview is a lie" scenario the brief asked about is NOT reachable today**: both sides are
re-serialised with identical flags (`json()` at `:255-261` matches the writer at
`Bootstrap.php:4525`), always newline-terminated, same key order. Clean bill otherwise: LCS tie-break
and hunk-merge threshold agree with GNU at the probed boundary (gap 6 merges, both), no phantom EOF
line, empty/identical/single-line inputs correct, `with*()` immutability correct and tested, no
`::create/::make/::default`, no `get*()`, all classes `final`, no missing methods in the consumer
contract, and `UnifiedScan`'s reset/oversized-header/`--- content` handling is solid.

### 1. [MINOR] Zero-context mid-file insertion headers mis-anchor relative to GNU
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed b876880a4 — GNU-faithful `-<lastline>,0` anchor and `,1` elision, verified against a 14-case live `diff(1)` oracle + `GnuHunkHeaderParityTest`; sugar-stash proven non-consumer.
- **WHERE:** `sugar-diff/src/Diff.php:406-414` (`assemble()` forces `oldStart = 0` whenever `oldLen === 0`).
- **WHAT:** For `withContextLines(0)` plus a pure insertion after line 1, the engine emits `@@ -0,0 +2,1 @@` where GNU emits `@@ -1,0 +2 @@`. An applier reading `-0,0` inserts at the wrong position. Documented as a faithful-port choice (`Hunk.php:12-17`, `README.md:71`), and `DiffTest.php:305-313` pins only zero-context *replacement*, which does agree with GNU.
- **FIX:** Match GNU's `-<lastline>,0` form for pure insertions, or restrict the documented choice to replacement and say so. Confirm with a `diff -U0` oracle run.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** no — preview-only consumer. Matters for sugar-stash, whose `DiffViewer::fromRawDiff()` consumes this text verbatim (`DiffTest.php:26-27`).

### 2. [INFO] `"x\n"` versus `"x"` diffs empty, so any future raw-disk preview can hide a trailing-newline change
- **STATUS ⏭ 2026-10-07:** kept — pinned behavior retained (crush normalises both sides; the newline invariant stays asserted).
- **WHERE:** documented rule, pinned by `DiffTest.php:168-176`.
- **WHAT:** Today crush normalises both sides so it cannot bite. A future caller that previews raw disk bytes against normalised bytes would silently omit a trailing-newline mutation from the diff it shows.
- **FIX:** Keep the invariant by asserting it at the consumer, or make the engine surface newline-only changes.

### 3. [INFO] Two diff engines coexist inside sugar-crush
- **STATUS ⏭ 2026-10-07:** DEFERRED — backlog fold item, out of campaign scope; noted that the twin now diverges from the library on hunk headers (b876880a4).
- **WHERE:** sugar-crush still ships its original 509-line `BuildsUnifiedDiff` trait, used by the Edit/Write/ApplyPatch tools; only `SettingsSavePreview` uses the library.
- **FIX:** Fold the trait onto sugar-diff so the fix in #1 lands in one place.

Also untested on this side: CRLF and lone-`\r` splitting (`Diff.php:134` leaves CR embedded — same as
GNU, so not a bug), combined `ignoreWhitespace+ignoreCase`, the zero-context insertion header shape,
and no invariant test that every hunk header's counts equal its body. Memory **is** bounded — the
`maxLcsCells = 250_000` cap at `Diff.php:194` collapses the middle to delete-all/insert-all rather
than OOMing, though timing was not measured (php execution denied).

# candy-pty

Lowest-level dependency and the best-hardened one in the round. The agent's conclusion is that
sugar-crush's path is clean: EINTR retry, `FD_CLOEXEC` with abort-on-failure, a measured fd-leak fix
in `close()`, fail-closed Darwin `stty` fallbacks, a loud Windows throw, `waitpid(WNOHANG)` fast
path, non-blocking destructor reaping. The pump/wait family (`PosixPump::pump`, `MultiPump::run`,
`ChildPollTrait::wait`) carries **no internal deadline by design** (E717, documented at
`PosixPump.php:22-43`), and sugar-crush correctly bounds every loop itself — 0.05 s reads, idle plus
wall ceilings, `ProcessReaper::escalate`, group-first `terminatePid`, `$pty->close()` in `finally`.
The test gates are right too: `requirePtySyscalls()` skips **loudly** (Windows / no ffi / no pcntl /
no `/dev/ptmx`), and `HangWatchdog` + `LoopPin` are installed in bootstrap in the documented order.

Note `src/Workflows/WorkflowEngine.php` references `PosixTermios` only in a doc-comment — it is not a
runtime pty user, so the real surface is `ProcessContainment` and `CapturesProcessOutput`.

### 1. [MINOR] `PosixMasterPty::read()` with `$timeout === null` inherits whatever blocking mode was last set
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed 9e80a9673 — docs-only contract on interface+impl stating the null-timeout blocking-mode inheritance; the lane's probe confirms the hang shape.
- **WHERE:** `candy-pty/src/Posix/PosixMasterPty.php` — a bare `fread` whose behaviour depends on whoever last called `stream_set_blocking`.
- **WHAT:** Can block forever on a quiet child. Unreachable from sugar-crush, which always passes a timeout, but any other consumer can wedge the UI from an async callback.
- **FIX:** Force non-blocking + select when a timeout is absent, or reject `null`.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** no.

### 2. [INFO] No `register_shutdown_function` termios-restore net anywhere; restore is caller-owned
- **STATUS ⏭ 2026-10-07:** verified as stated — caller-owned restoration is the contract; no defect.
- **WHAT:** Fine for sugar-crush — the child gets the pty slave and the user's real tty is never raw-moded — but it is a contract gap for a consumer that raw-modes the controlling terminal. If it ever does, a missed restore leaves the user's shell broken after exit, which is the worst outcome available in this dependency set.
- **FIX:** Either document "caller owns restoration" on the API or provide the net.

### 3. [INFO] `PosixChild::kill()` signals the process leader only
- **STATUS ⏭ 2026-10-07:** verified as stated — leader-only kill is the library's documented role; the group-kill setsid shim lives in sugar-crush; no defect.
- **WHERE:** `candy-pty/src/Posix/PosixChild.php`.
- **WHAT:** The `setsid`-in-shim guarantee that sugar-crush's group-kill relies on lives in sugar-crush, not in the library. Any other consumer doing a bare `kill()` leaks the group.

**Blocked, not clean:** `php tools/check-child-lifetimes.php` was never run (Bash denied). Run it, plus
`cd candy-pty && timeout 120 vendor/bin/phpunit --filter PosixMasterPtyTest` — single class only, per
the repo's own warning that pump-loop tests "can only hang, never fail".

RE-VERIFY 2026-10-08 (campaign rerun) — lane A7 (candy-pty Output/* test-support — SgrHandler / SgrState / AnsiOutputParser; probe evidence `p7`):
- **Item 4 [bright-alias default collision, MEDIUM] — FIXED (intended behavior change, upstream-faithful).** `SgrState::COLOR_DEFAULT` was 9 — exactly the palette slot SGR 91 (bright red) occupies — so an ESC[31m→ESC[91m transition compared equal to default and was silently dropped from the event log (probe `p7`: 2 events for a 3-change stream). Default is now an out-of-palette sentinel (-4); brights keep their xterm-faithful palette 8-15, gain named consts `COLOR_BRIGHT_BLACK`..`COLOR_BRIGHT_WHITE`, and `describe()` renders 8-15 as `fg=bright-<name>` (bright values previously rendered as nothing). All consumers are candy-pty test-support only (zero imports outside the lib tree-wide). Stale "revert to 9 (default)" comments truth-fixed; the `SgrStateTest::testColorConstants` pin flipped 9→-4 in-step with a why-comment plus a default∉0-15 non-collision assert. Pinned by four new handler tests (full 3-event stream, both 90-97/100-107 ranges each distinct from default by value, name and `equals()`, 39/49-from-bright return to default), a parser-level 3-transition pin, and bright `describe()` pins.
- **Item 5 [unbounded event growth, MEDIUM] — FIXED.** Consumers of `readChunk()` that never drained grew `SgrHandler::$events` without bound (probe: 2000 entries after 1000 undrained churns). The transition log is now capped at the documented `SgrHandler::MAX_EVENTS = 1024`, drop-OLDEST through a single private `record()`; the diagnostic/test-support surface loses the head of history, never the tail (stated in the const docblock). Pinned by `testUndrainedTransitionLogIsBoundedDropOldest`: churn past 2× the cap → size exactly at cap, the evicted head is the very first event (no surviving pair starts from default), newest reset event intact at the tail.
- **Item 6 [readChunk @return lie, LOW] — FIXED (docblock-only).** Said "without ANSI escape sequences"; the impl returns raw bytes. Truth-flipped to say so and point at `drainTransitions()`/`readChunkWithTransitions()`. Pinned by `testReadChunkReturnsRawBytesIncludingEscapes`.
- **Item 7 [reset() not clearing SGR state, LOW] — FIXED (docblock contract made true).** `AnsiOutputParser::reset()` now calls the new public `SgrHandler::reset()` (state → fresh default, event log emptied) in addition to `Parser::reset()`. Sole caller of `AnsiOutputParser::reset()` was its own test (grep-verified; test-support only), so the honest fix is the clearing one. The old pin `testResetClearsParserStateOnly` — which enshrined the broken survival — is flipped in-step (renamed `testResetClearsSgrState`), plus a multi-chunk clean-slate pin via a new `FakeMasterPtyQueue` fixture: paint red → reset → paint plain stays default with no phantom events.
- **Item 8 [truecolor sub-params unclamped, LOW] — FIXED.** 38;2/48;2 channels packed verbatim (300 bit-wrapped to 44 in `describe()`); now clamped 0-255 at parse time mirroring the `\max(0, \min(255, …))` idiom the 38;5 path already used. Pinned handler-level (`[38,2,300,-5,128]` → `fg=rgb(255,0,128)`; 300 in R vs G position stays distinguishable) and on the byte path (`"\x1b[38;2;300;0;0m"` → 255<<16). Negative params asserted via `csiDispatch` only — ECMA-48 byte parsing never produces them.
- **Pre-existing pty-section seam closed:** `php tools/check-child-lifetimes.php` (previously "never run (Bash denied)") ran on this lane: rc 0 — 61 libs / 28 proc_open sites / 7 findings, all 7 accounted (re-run at lane tip after the candy-top merges: 0 problems).
- **Gates:** candy-pty 696T/1959A/14S → **708T/3107A/14S** OK linked plain-pipe (+12T/+1148A, ~1m). sugar-crush `--filter 'Pty|Terminal'` OK **1367T/116282A/1S** (staleness pair outside the window, untouched — no suite-figure re-pin by this lane). Mutations 3/3 discriminating with cp+md5 restores: M-F1 sentinel reverted to 9 → 20+ pins red across all three suites (the out-of-palette default is load-bearing everywhere); M-F2 cap removed → exactly 1 failure (the ring pin); M-F5 fg clamps removed → exactly 2 failures (handler + byte-path clamp pins). No composer manifest touched, nothing pushed. Evidence `/tmp/opencode/crush-libs-rerun/A7/`.

# candy-sprinkles

`Style.php` is 1831 lines and was read in full, plus `Border`, `Border/BorderTitle`, `Table\Table`,
`Position`, `Layout`, `Bar/Segment` and the `Theme` surface. **The two things the brief ranked
hardest are genuinely clean**: immutability and sentinels (every setter routes `with()` → `new`, all
`$XSet` pairs present, all classes `final`, `::new()` only) and reset discipline (content SGR always
closed with `Ansi::reset()`; `NoTty` runs `Ansi::strip()` over the whole render — no terminal left
dirty). Contract divergence was closed by checking every `->open(`/`->close(`/`->getId(`/`->column(`
hit in sugar-crush: they are LSP/HTTP/WebSocket and sugar-bits objects, **not** Sprinkles.
`Theme::dark/light/dracula/tokyoNight/ansi` and the
`StatusBar::new()->separator()->caps()->left()->render()` / `Segment::of()` chains crush uses all
exist; crush never calls `transform`, `patch`, `inherit`, `hyperlink`, `tabWidth`, `paddingChar` or
`marginChar`.

### 1. [MINOR] `transform()` is applied after the border but before the margin, contradicting both its docblock and lipgloss
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed e802e3e18 — reordered to transform-first, verified against upstream lipgloss source; real behavior change (colored titles now paint on colored boxes); no crush test moved.
- **WHERE:** `candy-sprinkles/src/Style.php:1139-1143`; docblock says "just before its border / margin layer", lipgloss applies it last.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** no — crush never calls `transform()`.

### 2. [MINOR] Border titles are coloured from `borderFg` only
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed e802e3e18 — titles fall back to the side-0/2 edge colour when blended; 4 pins.
- **WHERE:** `candy-sprinkles/src/Style.php:1566`.
- **WHAT:** A style using per-side colours or a blended border foreground renders its titles uncoloured — `borderForegroundBlend()` writes `borderSideFg`, not `borderFg`.
- **USED-BY-CRUSH:** yes wherever a blended border carries a title; cosmetic.

---

## Disproved this round

Recorded so nobody re-files them.

- **candy-forms `Confirm` left/right inversion — FALSE.** An agent reported a MAJOR: "← meaning No
  saves Yes to config", claiming Left→true contradicts the pill layout. **LEAD-VERIFIED wrong.**
  `update()` maps Left/`h`→`true` (`candy-forms/src/Field/Confirm.php:127-133`) and `view()` renders
  `$yes . '   ' . $no` (`:162-166`) — Yes *is* the left pill. The mapping is correct and
  self-consistent. Do not spend time here. (Its real defect is only the docblock's `Tab` claim,
  filed above as candy-forms #3.)
- **sugar-veil `dimLine()` "near-no-op" — not a bug.** The ESC-skip is a deliberate, documented
  guard; downgraded to sugar-veil #4.
- **candy-layout two-solver divergence — cannot occur.** The simplex was deleted;
  `CassowarySolver::solve()` delegates wholly to `GreedySolver`.
  - ⏭ 2026-10-07: premise banner shipped to `findings/` via LL-docs 3862a4657; the 3 residual MINORs above stay open, out of campaign scope.
- **candy-mouse "Scan accumulates / dead zone stays hittable" — not a bug.** `Scanner::scan()`
  *replaces* the registry (`Scanner.php:59`) and sugar-crush's `scanRoot()` clears on marker-free
  frames and on throw. Staleness is a press/release-pairing problem (candy-mouse #1), not a registry
  problem.
- **sugar-toast "no integration test" — wrong premise.** `ApplySettingsTest.php:177-199` and
  `CompactionLiveSettingsTest.php:284` both exercise it.
- **candy-core prior-audit Critical #1 (`$len_of_buf`, `InputReader.php:195`) — confirmed fixed.** Its
  items 2-10 remain pending in `findings/candy-core.md`.

## Stale source-of-truth docs
- **STATUS ✅ 2026-10-07:** landed 3862a4657 — every file above now carries a re-verify banner / plan erratum (findings/*.md untouched by this closeout).

Six of fifteen agents spent budget discovering that `findings/<slug>.md` describes code that no
longer exists. This is the cheapest item in the report and it should be fixed before any repair work,
because otherwise the next pass redoes finished work:

- **candy-focus** — `findings/candy-focus.md` reviews a 373-line file and lists 10 open items
  (no `disabledIds()`, no `enabledCount()`/`disabledCount()`, no `IteratorAggregate`, no
  `JsonSerializable`, `ids()` leaking the internal array, `next()`/`previous()` duplicating 30 lines,
  O(n²) dedup). **All ten are implemented** in the current 521-line `FocusRing.php` (`:25` declares
  `Countable, IteratorAggregate, JsonSerializable`; `disabledIds()` `:439`, `enabledCount()` `:448`,
  `disabledCount()` `:454`, `ids()` returns `array_values(...)` `:508`, one shared `step()` `:321`,
  `unique()` `:99`). `plan_candy-focus.md` is still `status: not-started` with every phase PENDING.
- **candy-layout** — the old Cassowary cycling/tableau/BIG-M findings are premise-dead (above).
- **sugar-veil** — prior findings already fixed in tree: single accurate `dimLine()` docblock
  (`:593-608`), `isClickOutside()` now throws instead of returning false (`:327-331`, matching
  `README.md:239`), the `Manager` BC shim is gone, `RenderSession::release()` exists
  (`RenderSession.php:163-166`), `Fade::apply()` is a real gray-pen implementation (`Fade.php:49-75`),
  `compositeAll()`'s docblock rewritten (`VeilStack.php:101-112`).
- **candy-mouse** — Critical #1 (different-zone release leaks pending state) fixed at
  `ZoneClickTracker.php:83-86` and pinned by `ZoneClickTrackerTest.php:253`; High #3 (O(n) `hit()`)
  superseded by the grid index (`Scanner.php:116-163`); High #4 (`Scan` not reentrant) gone —
  `parse()` keeps state in locals (`Scan.php:130-140`); Low #10 — `composer.json` has no
  `repositories[]` block at all. `plan_candy-mouse.md` says `status: not-started` but the work is done.
- **candy-fuzzy** — **actively misleading**: §1.1 asks to delete the `if ($indices === [])` guard in
  `Highlighter.php:37-46`, which is now *load-bearing* after the out-of-range filter (pinned at
  `:143-150`). §2.1/plan 2.3 document a full-matrix memory limit the one-byte-traceback rework
  removed; §6.3/§7.1/§7.4/§8.1 are all implemented. Only the deprecated `ScoringProfile::default()`
  (`:73`) and `FuzzyMatcherFactory::create()` (`:59`) remain open, deliberately, pending candy-lister's
  `FuzzyMatch` migration (`CALIBER_LEARNINGS.md:79-81`).
- **candy-sprinkles** — `findings/candy-sprinkles.md` cites files that do not exist in this library.
- **sugar-toast** — `plan_sugar-toast.md` is `status: not-started` while its Phases 1-4 are
  demonstrably shipped: viewport clamping via `resolveWidth`/`capWidth` (`Toast.php:1014-1028` +
  `:500-508`), `cancelAlert`/`extendAlert`/`extendAll` (`:345-385`), nullable message
  (`Alert.php:26`, coalesced at `Toast.php:559,581`) and the `actions:` parameter (`:175,:199`).
  Findings 1, 2, 3, 8 of `findings/sugar-toast.md` are fixed; 9 and 10 verified. Its Phase 4.4 README
  item is the one still-open MINOR (sugar-toast #4).

**Also a convention non-finding, recorded so it stops being reported:** `candy-focus` and `candy-kit`
are required at `@dev` while 13 siblings are at `dev-master`. `tools/check-path-repos.php:33`
documents `@dev` as a bare alias for `dev-{default-branch}` and `$isDevConstraint` (`:320-324`) treats
it identically, so CI injects the same path-repo. Cosmetic; 7 such constraints exist repo-wide
(`candy-testing`, `sugar-dash`, `sugar-readline`, `sugar-stickers`, `docs/cookbook`).

# Repair priority
> **2026-10-07:** every item below was dispositioned inline in its library section — ✅ landed or ⏭ skipped/rejected/disproved.

1. **candy-mosaic #1** — the only correctness defect verified by hand, live on every non-graphics
   terminal, and the fix is three lines plus a real byte assertion.
2. **candy-mouse #1 and #2** — positional zone ids dispatched after a re-render, and a guessable
   sentinel neutralised only by three hand-maintained consumer calls. Both concern an app whose
   clickables include permission grants. Probe #1 before fixing it.
3. **candy-core #1** — `AsyncCmd` dispatching into a torn-down runtime. Add the missing
   `ProgramRuntimeTeardownTest` case first; the absent test is why this survived.
4. **candy-shine #1** — quadratic streaming repaint. Measure, then decide between more section
   boundaries and incremental tail rendering.
5. **sugar-mcp #3** — hung-holder wedging. The library fix is a documentation change plus a default
   `toolTimeoutSeconds` on sugar-crush's forked workers; #1 (Packagist) still gates installability
   and needs org access.
6. **candy-forms #1** — `TextArea` wrap and wide-character caret, in the settings/rename editors.
7. **sugar-toast #1 and #2** — both latent for crush today but each is a one-to-ten-line fix, and
   the README currently advises the `dismiss()` call that bricks the instance.
8. **candy-kit** — nothing to fix in the library; record in the E453 row that `SafeText::line()`
   strips newlines and that adopting it reverses `Help.php:37-41`, so the item is not costed as a
   restyle any more.
9. **Stale `findings/*.md`** — retrack or delete the seven files above.
10. Everything marked MINOR/INFO, plus sugar-mcp #2 (carried, still open, small).

## Backlog
- **STATUS 2026-10-07:** fold items (sugar-crush McpMessage/McpRouter/McpServer onto sugar-mcp, `LspExchangeLock` onto `ExchangeLock`, `BuildsUnifiedDiff` onto sugar-diff) ⏭ kept as noted — out of campaign scope; candy-kit E453 wiring stays open behind its content-model blocker (doc-recorded in 45b919a8e); the transitive-only audit and full execution-mode re-run stay open.

- Fold sugar-crush's parallel `McpMessage`/`McpRouter`/`McpServer` onto sugar-mcp's, and
  `LspExchangeLock` onto `ExchangeLock` (sugar-mcp #7), so hardening lands once.
- Fold sugar-crush's `BuildsUnifiedDiff` trait onto sugar-diff (sugar-diff #3).
- Wire candy-kit into `Cli/Help::screen()` (E453) — but only after the content-model question in
  candy-kit #1 is answered; the old blocker (HelpTest's anchored pins) is not the binding one.
- Audit the 7 transitive-only libraries: `candy-async`, `candy-buffer`, `candy-ansi`, `candy-input`,
  `candy-palette`, `candy-flip`, `honey-bounce`.
- Re-run this whole report with execution permitted. Nothing in it except the three LEAD-VERIFIED
  rows has been measured, and several rows explicitly say which probe would settle them.

## Coverage gaps (not reported does not mean clean)

- **Method:** no probe, phpunit or `php -l` ran in this round. `tools/check-child-lifetimes.php` and
  `tools/check-path-repos.php --unused` were both **blocked**, not passing.
- **Unaudited libraries:** the 7 transitive-only deps listed above.
- **candy-mosaic:** `ImageLayer`, `MosaicBuilder`, `DiskCache`, `AdaptiveImage`, `PrecomputedImage`,
  `Animation/AnimationDriver`, `ApngDecoder`, `Scale`, `CellSize`, `Deadline` — `ImageLayer` is on
  crush's hot path.
- **candy-core:** the agent read the sugar-crush-reachable surface only; `src/Util/Tty/*`,
  `src/Util/Proc/*`, `Util\{Clipboard,Editor,Open, Executable/Locator,LruMap}`, most of `src/Msg/*`,
  `src/Syntax/*`, `src/Cmd/*`, `src/Undo/*`, `ProgramOptions` remain unread from the previous round
  too.
- **candy-forms:** the widgets crush does not use: MultiSelect, Text, FilePicker, Date, Color,
  Slider, Note, Validator/*, plus lang/ locale parity.
- **candy-fuzzy:** `SahilmMatcher` has no caps (`:141-156`), though it is linear; not on crush's path.
- **candy-kit:** `Stage`'s spinner/golden interaction (SUSPECTED, above).
- **sugar-veil:** `Animation/AnimationKind.php` unread (15-line enum); `KeyHelpTest` not opened, so
  the existing overlay-chain coverage claim is unverified.
- **sugar-mcp:** `McpMessageTest.php` (177 lines) not opened.
- **candy-pty:** `src/Output/{AnsiOutputParser,SgrHandler,SgrState}.php`,
  `src/Input/PtyInputDecoder.php`, most of `src/Exception/*` and `src/Contract/*`.

2026-10-07 ADDENDUM — deferred backlog items now closed: crush BuildsUnifiedDiff twin folded onto sugar-diff @14725b088 (GNU-faithful headers adopted crush-wide); sugar-toast Width::nextCluster fork deduped onto candy-core public promotion @85466ebd2+793d9d959; candy-kit real terminal-width resolution @a403c6338; candy-focus reorder() disabled-head fallback @6eb057529; scripts/parallel-tests.sh default --timeout 900 @6f3c02321. Suite re-pinned 21,196T/406,402A @abbb45650.

RE-VERIFY 2026-10-08 (campaign rerun) — lane A3a (transitive trio: candy-buffer / candy-ansi / candy-async; probe evidence `p8a`):
- **candy-buffer B1 — FIXED @4ede1ce45.** `DiffEncoder::encode()` never emitted the trailing SGR reset its own comment promised; a styled-tail frame left the terminal carrying the rendition into the next raw write (both live consumers — veil `RenderSession.php:129`, dash `Chart.php:193` — return the bytes verbatim). Conditional `\x1b[0m` appended iff the stream ends styled, mirroring `toAnsi()`; 5 existing bleed pins flipped in-step, 4 new pins incl. the exact probe wire and a frame+erase concatenation.
- **candy-buffer B2 — FIXED @4ede1ce45.** `withCellAt()`/`fill()`/`withRegion()` could split a width-2 pair (orphaned continuation = permanent diff/toAnsi ghost; stranded lead on write-into-continuation). All three now route through `placeWithPair()` following applyDiff's null-continuation discipline (straddle-at-last-col keeps only the lead, matching applyDiff's silent clamp; `fromGrid()` stays the documented escape hatch). 8 pins in `tests/WideCellPairingTest`.
- **candy-buffer B3 — FIXED @4ede1ce45.** Bright black (`SGR 90` / `38;5;8`) returned `#000000` — invisible black-on-black on dark terminals; now canonical mid-grey `0x7F7F7F` per candy-palette `StandardColors`/xterm. `fromString` is fixture-only (zero production callers); exactly 1 fixture row encoded the wrong value and was flipped in-step, + 3 direct pins.
- **candy-ansi C1 — FIXED @3e7edc12e.** A cross-type C1 introducer mid-string kept the pending `stringBuffer`, so an APC/SOS/PM fragment rode into the foreign sequence's dispatch (`\x1b_a` + 0x9D + `b0;t` + BEL → `oscDispatch('ab0;t')`) — title-injection from untrusted peers. `Parser::start()` now discards the payload on a cross-type introducer; same-type re-introduction preserves it (existing pin untouched). Downstream: candy-vt's `testCrossKindC1IntroducerPreservesPayload` pinned the bleed shape itself — flipped to the new truth in the same commit (test-only, disclosed).
- **candy-ansi C2 — FIXED @3e7edc12e.** SOS/PM/APC Put stopped at 0x7F, so the anywhere UTF-8-lead edge won there: multi-byte runes inside those payloads printed mid-sequence and vanished from the dispatch (OSC/DCS already had the 0xFF extension). Put extended to 0x80–0xFF with the four string introducers + ST/ESC/CAN/SUB exits re-asserted; 4 raw-bytes-stay-in-payload pins.
- **candy-ansi C3 — FIXED @3e7edc12e.** `OscHandlerImpl::hyperlink()` docblock claimed an empty URI resets BOTH fields but a param-carrying close (`OSC 8;id=x;` → `hyperlink('','x')`) left `hyperlinkId` stale; behavior fixed to match the doc (zero production consumers of this impl — candy-vt ships its own — so no stickiness relied upon). Unit + through-parser pins.
- **candy-async A1 — FIXED @064b1c03a.** `fireCallbacks()` (public `@internal`) cleared the callback list without raising `$cancelled`; the direct-call path desynced `isCancelled()` observers and ghosted late `onCancel()` registrations. Flag now set on fire — consistent with the class invariant, byte-identical for the legitimate `acceptCancellationSource()` flow (it already sets the flag first); misuse-path pin + guard-rail pin.
- **Gates:** buffer 301T/1622A→315T/1748A, ansi 344T/852A→360T/901A, async 115T/252A→117T/259A, all OK linked plain-pipe; downstream at each commit: candy-vt 976T/12873A OK, sugar-veil full 258T/561A OK, sugar-dash `--filter Chart` 816T/1695A OK, sugar-crush `--filter 'Diff|Ansi'` 432T/13862A OK. 8/8 mutation proofs one-or-more-red-exactly-as-intended, restores md5-verified. Evidence `/tmp/opencode/crush-libs-rerun/A3a/`. The remaining four transitive-only libs (input/palette/flip/honey-bounce) are lane A3b.

RE-VERIFY 2026-10-08 (campaign rerun) — lane A3b (leaf four: candy-input / candy-palette / candy-flip / honey-bounce + sugar-reel guard; probe evidence `p8b`):
- **candy-input MAJOR — FIXED @76df005be.** `EscapeDecoder` kept a stale incomplete-CSI remainder across a PasteStart marker: the pre-boundary fragment re-buffered during the prefix re-parse and stitched onto the FIRST post-paste keystroke (`"\x1b[" + "x"` → unknown CSI → dropped). Paste-start is now an explicit resynchronisation boundary that flushes the remainder — crush-reachable via candy-pty. 2 pins (the arrow-key variant self-heals under a raw-ESC restart, so the plain-character pin is the discriminator; noted honestly).
- **candy-input — FIXED @76df005be.** `SignalResizeDriver` ctor mutated process-global signal disposition (pcntl_async_signals + SIGWINCH handler) and shell_exec'd tput twice, with zero repo consumers. Public API frozen pre-1.0, so construction is now side-effect-free and an explicit `arm()` opts into the globals — pinned both directions. `StreamInputDriver` restores the caller's blocking flag on destruct when the ctor cleared it. `ReactInputDriver::isReadable()` aligned to the React contract (pause defers emission; it does not make the stream unreadable) — one existing pin flipped in-step to the truthful polarity.
- **candy-palette MAJOR — FIXED @aa8955d75.** `NO_COLOR`/`CLICOLOR=0` were defeated by gate order: the terminfo phase ran unconditionally after the env phase set only the NoColor flag, so `hasTrueColor()` returned true anyway (sixel leg live, truecolor leg latent-until-Tc-terminfo). Suppression now short-circuits the whole capability ladder (Phases 2+3 skipped; CLICOLOR_FORCE keeps its override; BasicAscii floor intact). 6 truth-table pins over env × terminfo.
- **candy-palette MAJOR-dormant — FIXED @aa8955d75.** `AsyncProbe` (zero importers) bypassed every env gate, fabricated `TERM=xterm`, and spawned uncapped children. Now: DetectionChain consulted before spawning, no fabrication (unset/dumb TERM → sync path), `MAX_CONCURRENT_PROBES=4` with overflow degrading to the sync probe rather than queueing (disclosed shape), results documented advisory-only. 3 pins incl. reflection-driven cap exhaustion.
- **candy-palette — FIXED @aa8955d75.** `stripAnsi` missed CSI intermediate bytes, `@`/`_`-class finals and most 2-char ESC sequences (probe: 8/13 leaked); CSI rewritten per ECMA-48 (`[0-?]*[ -\/]*[@-~]`), ESC set extended, charset finals widened to `[ -~]` — all 13 probe shapes pinned. Env lookups unified through one helper — disclosed edge deviation: `CLICOLOR_FORCE` now also honours `$_ENV` (previously DI map + getenv only). `Color::ansi16Sgr` gained its 0-15 guard.
- **candy-palette INFO — NOT ACTIONED.** `StandardColors` mutable statics (frozen public surface pre-1.0; read-only in practice, no consumer writes them); `ProfileWriter` news a `Palette` per write (perf churn only, no correctness impact); `DetectionChain` attributes TMUX detection to a mislabelled `source()` string (cosmetic; behavior correct).
- **candy-flip + sugar-reel — FIXED @8825a3be0.** A crafted GIF header with zero logical-screen dimensions passed the pixel-budget gate and escaped `imagecreatetruecolor()` as a raw `ValueError`, breaking the documented `RuntimeException` contract; guarded at parse time (new `decoder.screen_too_small` key, all 16 locales). `sugar-reel` `GifDecoder:103` wraps the Flip call in a narrow `ValueError`→`RuntimeException` translation for the vendored-copy window. `Renderer::withConstraints` `@internal` docblock was a lie (Player.php:94 is a production caller) — truth-flipped.
- **honey-bounce — FIXED @0052eebea.** `Spring`/`Projectile` now reject non-finite numeric inputs and negative `deltaTime` at construction (INF damping poisoned every later tick to NaN via `0*INF`; NaN slipped the `max(0.0,·)` clamps; new lang keys ×16 locales). `CubicBezier` ctor rejects non-finite control points (the bare `<`/`>` range check is NaN-blind) and `sampleCurveDerivativeX` — which was not d/dt at all (returned −6·x1 at t=0, 0 for every x1===x2 curve) — replaced by the closed-form WebKit UnitBezier derivative, pinned against a central-difference oracle across all 26 presets.
- **honey-bounce easing research verdict.** `easeInOutCirc` shipped byte-identical to `easeInOutQuint` (0.86,0,0.07,1). The preset family demonstrably derives from the PRE-2022 easings.net approximation table (neighbours easeInOutExpo `(1,0,0,1)`, easeOutQuint `(0.23,1,0.32,1)`, easeInCirc `(0.60,0.04,0.98,0.34)` are exact/rounded originals), in which Quint `(0.86,0,0.07,1)` is the genuine row and Circ is `(0.785,0.135,0.15,0.86)` — so ONLY Circ changed, provenance cited in docblock + pin. The `easeIn()`-holds-CSS-`ease` probe finding was REFUTED via `git log -p` (it always held `(0.42,0,1,1)`); no change. `evaluate()` documented honestly: y unclamped by design (elastic/back overshoot is the point), out-of-domain t extrapolates; pinned both.
- **honey-bounce INFO — NOT ACTIONED.** Suspect digit-drift preset rows (`easeInQuint` y-tail `0.00`, `easeInQuart` `(0.70,0,0.84,0)`, `easeInOutQuad` `(0.46,0.03,0.52,0.64)`) are close-but-not-exact neighbours of the same original table and were outside the brief's identical-tuple finding — left untouched to avoid un-evidenced curve edits.
- **Gates:** input 403T/41362A→409T/41381A, palette 504T/5484A→529T/5537A, flip 111T/316A→112T/318A, bounce 193T/5571A→210T/6088A, all OK linked plain-pipe; sugar-reel `--filter 'Gif|Decoder'` OK 101T/380A; downstream sugar-crush `--filter 'Input|Escape|Palette'` OK 894T/5488A, candy-mosaic `--filter Flip` OK 7T/63A. 5/5 mutation proofs red-exactly-as-intended (remainder flush, ladder gate, screen guard, derivative closed form, CSI regex), restores md5-verified. Evidence `/tmp/opencode/crush-libs-rerun/A3b/`.

RE-VERIFY 2026-10-08 (campaign rerun) — lane A4 (candy-mosaic N1–N5 / candy-forms F-P4-1..5 / sugar-crush pane-cycle; probe evidence `p2`, `p4`, `p3`):
- **candy-mosaic MAJOR — FIXED @5b063f208.** `Deadline::in($ms)` added `ms*1000` to a NANOSECOND `hrtime(true)` clock — every budget read expired 1000x early (a 5000 ms budget died at 10 ms). Crush-reachable via `Mosaic::auto()` → `Detect::probe()` (ToolResult image path), truncating multi-chunk terminal-capability probes. Fixed to honest ms↔ns math (+ public `isExpired()`); call-site audit: both `Detect.php` sites use `remaining()*1000` only as stream_select µs — no compensating fudges existed anywhere. `tests/DeadlineTest.php` did not exist; added with 6 pins incl. the exact regression shape (arm 5000 ms, ~20 ms wall sleep, still live) and a drain-rate bound.
- **candy-mosaic — FIXED @5b063f208.** N2 `Scale::fill()`/`crop()` clamped the destination but not the SOURCE rect at extreme aspect ratios (0-sized rect handed to `imagecrop()`) — both dims floor at 1, both degenerate directions pinned. N3 `AdaptiveImage` `maxCache<1` silently evicted the just-cached entry — ctor clamps to ≥1; `withAsync()` docblock truth-flipped (no cache continuity). N4 `AnimationDriver` turned an APNG fcTL delay of 0 into `Cmd::tick(0.0)` — an unthrottled busy-loop; new `MIN_TICK_MS=10` floor at both tick arms (GIF/APNG netscape-loop-0 sentinel precedent: 0 means infinite/missing, never fast). N5 `ImageLayer::placeTracked` assigned the digest id BEFORE the `MAX_IMAGES` capacity early-return so the table kept growing past exhaustion — claim-after-guard, overflow blobs render blank (6398-cap pin).
- **candy-forms MAJOR — FIXED @4cb8705fd.** `Field/FilePicker.php` echoed the selected path raw into `view()` — the one display site the wrapper never cleaned while the inner widget's cwd/entry rows and every sibling field route through `RenderSafe::clean()` — so a crafted filename carried ESC sequences straight into the terminal stream. The line now cleans at render; the field VALUE stays raw (cleaning is display-only). Pinned with a live temp-dir fixture selecting an ESC-bearing filename. Disclosed deviation: the pin follows the sibling convention (injected `\x1b[2J` gone, remainder printable) rather than a literal zero-ESC assertion, because `RenderSafe` preserves true SGR by design and the focused row legitimately styles.
- **candy-forms — FIXED @4cb8705fd.** F-P4-2 Date/Color docblocks advertised `^ / v` page keys and a false "KeyMap binds j/k" rationale — `KeyMap::new()` binds neither; docblocks rewritten to the bound truth, NO bindings added (behavior ruling: docs were aspirational; keymaps ship through the sugar-bits/sugar-prompt façades). F-P4-3 Note's "Enter / Space activates" — Space is bound nowhere; Enter advances via the Form's generic arm — both docblocks truth-flipped. F-P4-4 `MultiSelect::toggle()`'s hard-coded "Pick at most N." routed through `Lang::t('multiselect.pick_at_most')` — the key already shipped in `lang/en.php` (no new key; en is the only locale, and ErrorHelpTest's byte-pin proves the rendered message unchanged).
- **candy-forms ⏭ OPEN RULING.** F-P4-5 PageUp polarity differs between widgets: `Field/Color.php:166-167` PageUp → red channel +1 (advance) vs `Field/Date.php:191` PageUp → `shiftMonth(-1)` (retreat). Same key, opposite semantic direction. Behavior left unchanged pre-1.0 pending owner sign-off (and if unified, which direction wins incl. the PageDown pairing).
- **sugar-crush — FIXED @196079294.** `App::paneCycleOrder()` listed dock slots without the `dockable()` filter `Renderer::sidePanes()` applies: a stale/hand-edited manifest naming input/help/menu put those panes in the Tab cycle while the frame never painted them — focus parked on a pane whose `renderPane()` defaults to `''` (p3 probe reproduced the asymmetry). The cycle now skips non-dockable ids exactly like the painted columns; 2 pins (all-polluted column → Tab stays Chat; mixed column → cycle `[Chat, Skills]`, round-trip skips the poisoned name).
- **Gates:** mosaic 648T/8284A→661T/14820A (5S intact), forms 2271T/4222A→2272T/4226A, both OK linked plain-pipe; consumers green — sugar-bits 514T/1092A, sugar-prompt picker filter 2T; sugar-crush `--filter 'Pane|Dock|Cycle|Focus'` OK 847T/17459A (staleness pair outside the window; suite-figure re-pin owed at campaign closeout, not here). 8/8 mutation proofs red-exactly-as-intended (unit math, fill floor, crop floors, cache clamp, tick floor, claim ordering, raw-echo revert, dockable-filter re-drop), restores md5-verified. Evidence `/tmp/opencode/crush-libs-rerun/A4/`.

RE-VERIFY 2026-10-08 (campaign rerun) — lane A5 (candy-layout width-sum sweep / drag memo / roundSplit doc; probe+bench evidence `A5`):
- **Row 1 [width-sum sweep] — FIXED (tests-only).** New `candy-layout/tests/WidthSumInvariantSweepTest.php`, 11T/2153A, deterministic grid: full 3-region Dock (9 share-pairs × 4 minimum-pairs × stack shapes × widths 1..200) asserting exact contiguous column tiling of the frame + scalar-projection determinism; GreedySolver sweeps — fraction sets (thirds/halves/twelfths/tenths/mixed/zero-Fill + trailing Fill, n=1..6) × widths 1..200 both directions; exact-sum sets in floor AND roundSplit modes; over-constrained truncation tiles; under-constrained fixed sets keep their documented trailing gap (sizes stay [5×6]); Min/Max paths; minShare floor all-Fill sets; `withRemainderToLast()` Max-free sets; deprecated Cassowary path byte-identical to delegation target. **Zero allocator violations found — the invariant holds; no behavior fix was needed and the sweep is now the pin.** Suite 282T/1162A → 293T/3315A OK.
- **Row 2 [drag memoization] — NO-ACTION (measure-first ruling).** Micro-bench (PHP 8.3.6, 3000 iters, 200 warm, `A5/bench-drag.php`): `DockLayout::resolve()` 12-pane 200×50 = **0.0679 ms/op**; resolve+3 `regionFor` drag step 0.0735; `isUntouchedDefaultDock()` double-`toArray()` 0.0183; composite `sideWidth()` per render-per-side 0.0802; 30-pane 240×60 0.1319 ms/op. Real crush docks run ≤~12 panes; per-mousemove cost ≈0.1–0.2 ms against a tens-of-ms frame paint — below the ~0.1 ms/op act threshold, and a keyed memo would fight the lib's `final readonly` immutable-value style. Memoization skipped with recorded numbers.
- **Row 3 [roundSplit doc note] — FIXED (docblock-only, zero behavior change).** `GreedySolver::withRoundSplit()` now states the fractional-width determinism contract: both branches cast an IEEE-754 double through one PHP-core function (`(int) round(...)` half-away-from-zero when ON, `(int) floor(...)` when OFF) over integer operands, so same input ⇒ same cell widths on every build; the floor-vs-round POLICY is the only divergence and is flag-chosen (sugar-crush never enables it — its path is floor-only, exact-int `mulDivFloor` on the Dock side). Constructor `@param $roundSplit` cross-refs it. Pinned by `testRoundSplitRoundsHalfAwayFromZero` (discriminating shape `Percentage(50)+Fill(1)` @ w=5 → floor [2,3] vs round [3,2]; symmetric halves without a Fill absorber reconcile to the same tiling — also stated).
- **Disclosure — concurrent zombie-writer dirt.** This clone hosted a duplicate A5 writer mid-lane: an untracked `candy-layout/tests/WidthSumInvariantTest.php` (~12:09) whose "repeat solve diverged" failures were proven spurious (its arm compared arrays of fresh `Region` instances with `!==` — instance identity, always unequal; scalar projections are identical: `fill-single` @ w=7 yields `[7]` from every repeat call), and an 11-line docblock insertion into `src/GreedySolver.php` (~12:32). Resolution: the docblock's content was independently re-verified honest and is KEPT (test citation corrected to the actually-shipped class); the zombie test file is deleted from the tree and archived at `A5/foreign-WidthSumInvariantTest.php`; its one genuinely-new claim (`remainderToLast` tiles Max-free shapes) was re-probed clean (7 sets × widths 1..200, 0 underfills) and folded in as `testRemainderToLastTilesEveryMaxFreeSet`.
- **Gates:** candy-layout 293T/3315A OK (baseline 282T/1162A, +11T/+2153A), linked plain-pipe; sugar-crush `--filter 'Layout|Box|Flex'` OK 189T/8861A (staleness pair outside the window, untouched); candy-query `--filter 'Layout'` — no such tests exist. No composer manifest touched, no path-repos, nothing pushed. Evidence `/tmp/opencode/crush-libs-rerun/A5/` (baseline/final suite logs, probes, bench, consumer logs, foreign-file archive).

RE-VERIFY 2026-10-08 (campaign rerun) — lane A6 (candy-kit E453 multi-line variant + sugar-crush Help wiring; evidence `A6`):
- **Row 1 [E453 content-model blocker] — FIXED (the wiring itself landed).** Reproduced first: the page `Help::screen()` serves is byte-clean today (`A6/help-screen-before.txt`, 380 rows / 24059 B) but routing it through the only kit entry that existed collapses it to ONE row (`A6/help-via-existing-helptext.txt`, 0 newlines) — `SafeText::line()` strips all C0 incl. LF, and DocFigure's own pin proved `src/` reached candy-kit in zero files. Campaign ruling honored: the i18n page contract at `Help.php:37-41` (translate-as-a-page, never split per-row) is KEPT verbatim — instead the kit grew the multi-line-preserving counterpart the FIX row named as the alternative: `SafeText::page()` (strips escapes + every C0/DEL except LF; tab and CR go, so CRLF normalizes to bare-LF rows) and `HelpText::renderPage(string $page, int|AutoWidth|null $width = null)` (sanitize always; wrap over-long rows cell-aware only on explicit/Auto width; DEFAULT null = never re-flow an authored page — the deliberate divergence from the siblings' `AutoWidth::Auto`). `Cli/Help::screen()` now returns `HelpText::renderPage(Lang::t('cli.help.screen'))`: byte-identical for the clean English page (pinned), and a poisoned catalogue now gets sanitized WITHOUT losing its rows (behavioural pin via `T::overrideNamespace` throwaway catalogue). `render()`'s single-line flattening contract is untouched (polarity pin added).
- **Deferral record retired exactly as it instructed.** The `extra.sugarcraft.deferred-wiring` row ("Delete this row when the wiring lands — never to quiet the check") and its DocFigure pin `testCandyKitDeferredWiringRowMatchesWhatItRecords` went in the kit-adjacent commit; `tools/check-path-repos.php --unused` now exits 0 with candy-kit genuinely reached (no PRUNE, no DEFERRED_WIRING), and `ManifestDependencyReachTest` gained a permanent anti-vacuity floor in the row-control's place: `src/` MUST keep reaching `SugarCraft\Kit\` (Rule 25's known-positive pair now runs only while some future row exists). Class docblock history paragraph truth-flipped.
- **Rows 2–5 — no action, still landed** (45b919a8e: Banner width param, WidthProbe/AutoWidth resolution at a403c6338, shared WidthGuard, SafeText fail-loud — all re-verified in tree and green; renderPage rides the same WidthGuard/WidthProbe idiom). SUSPECTED Stage-golden row re-proved ⏭: `--filter 'Progress|Banner'` OK 22T/51A, goldens unshifted.
- **Gates:** candy-kit 260T/1582A → **272T/1634A** OK linked plain-pipe (+12T/+52A: 8 renderPage + 3 SafeText::page pins + 1 polarity guard); sugar-crush `--filter 'DocFigure|ReadmeRoster|SymbolCitation|ManifestDependencyReach|Help'` OK **323T/118998A** (net crush delta +1T: −1 retired DocFigure arm, +2 HelpTest pins); guard family `--filter 'ReadmeSuiteFigureDrift|GlobDialect|DuplicatedTestHelper|SwallowingCatch|OneSidedHome|ChildWallClock'` 57T with ONLY the known staleness pair red by design (live 21,198 vs pinned 21,267 — re-pin owed at campaign closeout, NOT here). `check-path-repos --no-lib-path-repos` and `--unused` both rc 0. Mutation proofs 2/2: kit LF-preservation neuter → 6 of 11 page pins red; Help call-site revert → exactly the poison-catalogue pin red (byte-identity pin correctly stays green — raw Lang::t IS identity for clean text); restores md5-verified. Evidence `/tmp/opencode/crush-libs-rerun/A6/`.

## CLOSEOUT 2026-10-08 (campaign rerun) — final gate

- **Wave-1 re-verify executed:** eight probe lanes (p1 core/sprinkles, p2 mosaic, p3 mouse/focus/veil,
  p4 shine/forms, p5 mcp, p6 toast/kit/layout, p7 pty/diff, p8a+p8b transitive-7) re-derived every
  ✅-marked row of this audit against source at the campaign tip — all landed rows confirmed, verdict
  sources under `/tmp/opencode/crush-libs-rerun/p1..p8b/`. No ✅ row was found false.
- **Transitive-7 first-time audit closed:** candy-buffer / candy-ansi / candy-async (lane A3a) and
  candy-input / candy-palette / candy-flip / honey-bounce (lane A3b) — every finding dispositioned
  FIXED/⏭ in the two blocks above; the "Unaudited libraries" coverage row is discharged.
- **Repairs shipped per lane (SHAs in each RE-VERIFY block):** A1 census roster 365b4ba4e;
  A2 sugar-mcp folds 449298e62 / bdc13dea0 / a9228639c; A3a 4ede1ce45 / 3e7edc12e / 064b1c03a;
  A3b 76df005be / aa8955d75 / 8825a3be0 / 0052eebea; A4 5b063f208 / 4cb8705fd / 196079294;
  A5 layout sweep + roundSplit doc; A6 candy-kit renderPage + Help wiring e33d7c733;
  A7 candy-pty Output/* items 4–8 (000888cf8 and siblings).
- **Gate lane (this closeout):** sugar-toast section re-verified row-by-row — all six items ✅ LANDED
  (item 3 superseded stronger by the fork deletion @793d9d959), suite 278T/669A OK; the two
  coverage-section test-addition rows verified on disk. One cross-lane regression found and fixed:
  lane A6's Cli/HelpTest poison-catalogue glob was never licensed in
  `TreeWideGuardRosterTest::WALKS_A_DIRECTORY_THE_TEST_MADE` (reddened 2 serial arms) — roster row
  added in-step.
- **Final weld figures (serial, linked, cwd=sugar-crush, PHP 8.3.6, 2026-10-08):**
  **21,198 tests / 406,450 assertions / 0F / 0E / 1S (McpClientTest canary) / exit 0**, 40m56s.
  The staleness pair (pinned 21,267 from the mid-campaign operator weld vs live 21,198 after the
  façade-law test deletions) is RESOLVED by this re-pin: README headline + suite-figure.json +
  durations.tsv (1,184 rows, determinism-proven across two regenerations) all carry the green-serial
  truth. K=8 sharded gate: CONSERVATION PASS (tests/skipped/errors/failures exact; assertions +17
  provider wobble tolerated by design). Repo gates: check-path-repos rc 0, check-child-lifetimes rc 0
  (7 findings / 7 accounted). Nothing pushed, per campaign law.
